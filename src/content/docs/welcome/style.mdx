title: Style Requirements
description: Understand the style requirements for the course, including following the Google C++ Style Guide and using cpplint to ensure your code meets the standards.
---

In **CSCE146**, you may have followed a simple formatting requirement, like right-clicking in the **Eclipse IDE** 
and selecting "Format" to tidy up your code before submission. However, **CSCE240** introduces stricter style 
guidelines, requiring attention to details such as maximum column lengths, case sensitivity in naming, and more.

## C++ Google Style Guide

This course follows the <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">C++ Google Style Guide</a>.
As we cover each topic, you'll be introduced to specific styling conventions relevant to that section. A [Style Reference](../reference/style) 
has been written to quickly find any **style requirements** you may have forgotten.

## Cpplint Style Checker

We'll be using a tool called `cpplint` to check your code for **styling errors**. While `cpplint` will catch most issues, 
there are certain cases where it might not flag a **styling error**, even if one exists. A [Cpplint Reference](../reference/ccplint) is available, 
listing common issues, solutions, and other FAQs related to `cpplint`. The version of `cpplint` you download will depend on 
your operating system.

## Coding Snippets

The previous sections involved some tedious micro-management, but don't worry—coding snippets provided on this site are 😁 pre-styled and 
already pass `cpplint`!

## Code Editor

Ready for some 🫣 great news? Editors like <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visual Studio Code</a> 
come with auto-formatting options that follow the 🫡 Google Style Guide! While it's not perfect and won't catch every style requirement, it will 
take care of most of the heavy lifting, such as indentation and column length.

## Basic Style Requirements

To get you started, here are a couple of style rules that you will always deal with:

### Beginner Bracket Placement

You may have noticed from the code snippets the bracket of the **main** function is always placed on the same line as the **associated statement**. 
This is because it is a required style. If the statement is short enough, as seen in previous code snippets, the ending bracket can also be in the same line. 
Bracket placement will be expanded further in the guide. 

The **Driver** tab shows the correct styling whilst the **Terminal** tab shows the **error** when styled incorrectly.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Driver" icon="rocket">
<Code code={code.brackets} lang="cpp" title="driver.cc"/>
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Terminal" icon="laptop">
<Code code={code.bracketsErrors} lang="bash"/>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Column Length

Do **NOT** go past column 80. If you do, you get the following **error** shown on the **Terminal** tab. Even though it looks awkward the 
**Driver** code is formatted correctly.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Driver" icon="rocket">
<Code code={code.columnLength} lang="cpp" title="driver.cc"/>
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Terminal" icon="laptop">
<Code code={code.columnError} lang="bash"/>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Copyright

Just like in CSCE145 and CSCE146, you are required to **author each page through a comment** at the top of your file. The syntax is `Copyright <year> <name>`. In coding snippets, CSCE240 
will be used as the name. The **Terminal** tab shows you the **error** you get if you don't author your file:

import { Code, TabItem, Tabs } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import { code } from "./style"

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Driver" icon="rocket">
<Code code={code.copyright} lang="cpp" title="driver.cc"/>
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Terminal" icon="laptop">
<Code code={code.copyrightError} lang="bash"/>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Indentation

In the Google C++ Style Guide, 2-space indentation is a strict requirement per indentation level. If you like to use the Tab key 
for coding, you may be able to set your Tab Length to 2. This is the first case where `cpplint` does NOT detect the error. The 
**Driver** shows various levels of indentation done correctly.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Driver" icon="rocket">
<Code code={code.indent} lang="cpp" title="driver.cc"/>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>


### Newline Character

Every document should end with a blank line at the end. Here's the slight 😬 **caveat** with the coding snippets. The coding snippets
trim blank lines at the end of strings, therefore I currently have no *reasonable* way to provide a code snippet with a blank line at the end. The 
following snippet shows the **error** you get:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Terminal" icon="laptop">
<Code code={code.newline} lang="bash"/>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
