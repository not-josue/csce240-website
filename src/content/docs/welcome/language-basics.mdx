description: Discover the building blocks of C++, from classes and functions to the steps involved in creating and structuring a program.
---

In C++, the fundamental building blocks of any program are **functions** and **classes**. Functions allow you to define 
**reusable blocks of code** that perform specific tasks, while classes provide a way to organize and **structure data 
and behavior**. Understanding these two concepts is key to mastering C++ and creating **efficient, modular programs**.

## Functions

At first, when you start writing C++ programs, you'll primarily work with a special function called **main**, which serves as 
the **entry point of every program**. All your code will be written inside this function. 

As your programs grow larger, you'll want to organize your code by **separating it into different functions**. This allows for 
better structure, reusability, and readability. Later on, you'll also learn how to place these functions in separate files to 
keep your projects **organized and manageable**.

import { code } from "@ts/welcome/basics"

<Code code={code.functions} lang="cpp" title="driver.cc"/>


## Classes

In the second half of the course, you'll start creating your own classes to model real-world concepts and **organize your code 
more effectively**. Classes are a powerful feature in C++ that let you define custom data types with both properties **(variables)** 
and behaviors **(functions)**. 

From the very beginning, you'll work with two **special objects** of the `iostream` class: `cin` for **input** 
and `cout` for **output**. These objects will help you interact with the user and display results as you begin writing more complex 
programs.

## C++ Creation Process

The creation process of a C++ program involves 6 steps:

1. Edit
2. Preprocess
3. Compile
4. Link
5. Load
6. Execute

### Edit

The first step in creating a C++ program is writing the code in a text editor. This is where the programmer writes and organizes their 
instructions for the program. Popular text editors for C++ include Visual Studio Code, CLion, and Sublime Text, though you can use any 
editor you're comfortable with. For this course, you will be saving files with the following extensions: `.cc`, `.h`, and `makefile`.

### Preprocess

Before the source code is compiled, the preprocessor handles all **preprocessor directives**, which are instructions that begin with a `#` symbol. 
These directives are executed to prepare the code for compilation. Common tasks performed during this step include adding header files 
(e.g., `#include <iostream>`), or like (e.g., `#include "program.h"`), and performing **conditional compilation**. The preprocessor ensures that your 
code is properly set up before moving to the **compilation stage**.

<Code code={code.preprocess} lang="cpp" title="driver.cc"/>

### Compile

In this step, the compiler translates your source code into **object code**, a lower-level representation that the computer can understand. 
In this course, you'll use the `g++` compiler to perform this task. To compile a file into **object code**, you can use the `-c` flag with the 
following command:

<Code code={code.compile} lang="bash"/>

This will generate an **object file** (e.g., `driver.o`) that is ready for the next step in the process.

<Aside>Remember that your location in the terminal has to be in the same folder as your code!</Aside>

<FileTree>

- CSCE240
    - **Project01**
        - driver.cc
        - driver.o
    - Project02
        - TODO.md

</FileTree>

### Link

The **linker** takes the **object code files** produced during the compile step and combines them into a single **executable file**. This step ensures 
that all the necessary code, including libraries and other dependencies, is properly connected. In this course, you'll use the `g++` compiler 
as the **linker** with the following command:

<Code code={code.link01} lang="bash"/>

The terminal command creates an `a.out` executable file by default since no name for the executable was defined. If you would 
like to name your executable file you can use the `-o` flag followed by the desired name.

<Code code={code.link02} lang="bash"/>

This terminal command creates a `driver` executable file.

<Aside>Most if not all example code in this course uses the default `a.out`.</Aside>

### Load

During this step, the **loader** brings the executable file into memory, preparing it for **execution**. This involves allocating the necessary 
resources and **setting up the environment** so the program can run smoothly. The operating system handles this process automatically, 
ensuring the executable is ready to execute its instructions.

### Execute

In the final step, the program is **run directly from memory**. The CPU executes the instructions in the **executable file**, producing the desired 
output or performing the intended tasks. To run the executable file, use the following command:

<Code code={code.execute} lang="bash"/>

<Aside>
This command assumes the default output file name, `a.out`. If you specified a different name during the **linking step** 
(e.g., `-o myprogram`), replace `a.out` with the name of your **executable**.
