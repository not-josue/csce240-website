In **CSCE146**, you may have followed a simple formatting requirement, like right-clicking in the **Eclipse IDE** 
and selecting "Format" to tidy up your code before submission. However, **CSCE240** introduces stricter style 
guidelines, requiring attention to details such as maximum column lengths, case sensitivity in naming, and more.

## C++ Google Style Guide

This course follows the <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">C++ Google Style Guide</a>.
As we cover each topic, you'll be introduced to specific styling conventions relevant to that section. A [Style Reference](../references/google-style-reference) 
has been written to quickly find any **style requirements** you may have forgotten.

## Cpplint Style Checker

You'll be using a tool called `cpplint` to check your code for **styling errors**. While `cpplint` will catch most issues, 
there are certain cases where it might not flag a **styling error**, even if one exists. A [Cpplint Reference](../references/cpplint-reference) is available, 
listing common issues, solutions, and other FAQs related to `cpplint`. The version of `cpplint` you download will depend on 
your operating system. To check your files, use `cpplint <filename>` where `<filename>` is replaced by the name of the file and the 
extension (for this course `.h` and `.cc`).

## Coding Snippets

The previous sections involved some tedious micro-management, but don't worry‚Äîcoding snippets provided on this site are üòÅ pre-styled and 
already pass `cpplint`!

## Code Editor

Ready for some ü´£ great news? Editors like <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visual Studio Code</a> 
come with auto-formatting options that follow the ü´° Google Style Guide! While it's not perfect and won't catch every style requirement, it will 
take care of most of the heavy lifting, such as indentation and column length.

## Basic Style Requirements

To get you started, here are a couple of style rules that you will always deal with:

<Aside>The **Correct Style** tab contains the correct style, the **Terminal Error** tab contains the error you get for incorrect styling.</Aside>

### Column Length

Do **NOT** go past column 80. Though the example looks awkward, it is styled correctly!

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Correct Style" icon="approve-check">
<Code code={code.columnLength} lang="cpp" title="driver.cc"/>
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Terminal Error" icon="error">
<Code code={code.columnError} lang="bash"/>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Copyright

Just like in CSCE145 and CSCE146, you are required to **author each page through a comment** at the top of your file. The syntax is `Copyright <year> <name>`. In coding snippets, CSCE240 
will be used as the name.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Correct Style" icon="approve-check">
<Code code={code.copyright} lang="cpp" title="driver.cc"/>
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Terminal Error" icon="error">
<Code code={code.copyrightError} lang="bash"/>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Indentation

In the Google C++ Style Guide, 2-space indentation is a strict requirement per indentation level. If you like to use the Tab key 
for coding, you may be able to set your Tab Length to 2. The **Driver** shows various levels of indentation done correctly.

<Aside type='danger'>This is the first case where `cpplint` does **NOT** detect the error.</Aside>

<Code code={code.indent} lang="cpp" title="driver.cc"/>

### Main Function

You may have noticed from the code snippets the braces of the **main** function is always placed on the same line as the **associated statement**. 
This is because it is a required style. If the statement is short enough, as seen in previous code snippets, the ending braces can also be in the same line. 
Braces placement will be expanded further in the guide.

A couple of extra requirements is that parenthesis () should be next to the function's name, and you should have a single space between 
the parenthesis and the opening bracket.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Correct Style" icon="approve-check">
<Code code={code.braces} lang="cpp" title="driver.cc"/>
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Terminal Error" icon="error">
<Code code={code.bracesErrors} lang="bash"/>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Newline Character

Every document should end with a blank line at the end. Pretty simple.

<Aside type='danger'>Coding snippets do **NOT** come with an empty blank line at the end thus will not pass this requirement in `cpplint`.</Aside>

<Code code={code.newline} title='Terminal Error' lang="bash"/>
