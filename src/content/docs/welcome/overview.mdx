üëã **Hello, USC!** This website was created to support fellow students at the **University of South Carolina** who are currently taking, or planning to 
take, **CSCE240: Advanced Programming Techniques**. Just as **CSCE145** and **CSCE146** have dedicated websites, I felt that **CSCE240** deserved 
one too!
  
In general, I believe that every programming course should have a modern website. I think of this project as a way to help üï∏Ô∏è **"Webify"** USC.

## What This Website Is 

This website serves as both a preparation tool and a quick reference tool for **CSCE240**. Key technical terminology introduced 
in the course is presented with straightforward explanations, often drawing on concepts from **CSCE146**. 
  
You'll also find code snippets which you can copy into your editor, complete with expected terminal outputs for verification. Below are examples 
of 4 files to paste code in, along with the expected terminal output. üòä Don't worry if you don't understand the code or the filenames, we'll get to 
that later!

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Makefile" icon="seti:makefile">
<Code code={code.makefile} lang="makefile" title="makefile"  />
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Header" icon="document">
<Code code={code.header} lang="cpp" title="hello.h"/>
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Source" icon="seti:cpp">
<Code code={code.cc} lang="cpp" title="hello.cc"/>
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Driver" icon="rocket">
<Code code={code.driver} lang="cpp" title="driver.cc"/>
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Terminal" icon="laptop">
<Code code={code.terminal} lang="bash"/>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Recommended Folder Structure

To keep your code organized throughout the semester, the following folder structure is recommended for this course. While not mandatory, 
using this structure can make navigating and managing your files much easier as the class progresses.

## What This Website Is Not

This website is **NOT** a substitute for lectures. The summarized concepts and coding snippets do not replace the thorough explanations nor the 
long coding examples provided during lectures. Lecture is meant to prepare you for your upcoming coding assignments and for your exams. This 
website is a place to come back to when you don't remember what something means or why you have an üòï error.
