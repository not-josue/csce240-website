In C++, scope refers to **the region of a program where a variable or identifier is accessible**. 
Understanding the different types of scope is crucial for managing variable visibility and preventing 
naming conflicts.

## Types Of Scope

You'll run into various situations in CSCE240 that will test your familiarity of scopes. 
Here are the main types of scopes you'll see in the course:

### Block Scope 

Variables declared inside a block (enclosed by {}) are only accessible within that 
block and its sub-blocks.

```cpp
{
  int x = 10;  // x is accessible only inside this block
}
// x is not accessible here
```

### File Scope: 

Variables declared outside of any block are accessible anywhere in the file. 
These are often called global variables.

```cpp
// Copyright 2024 CSCE240
#include <iostream>
using std::cout;
using std::endl;

int global_var = 5;

int main() {
  cout << global_var << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

### Function Scope 

Parameters named in a function implementation are accessible only within that function.

```cpp
void example(int y) {
  // y is accessible only inside this function
}
```

### Class Scope

Variables and methods defined within a class are accessible within the class. 
Additional details, such as access modifiers (`private`, `public`, `protected`), will be discussed later.

```cpp
class MyClass {
  int data_member_;  // Class scope
};
```

### Namespace Scope 

Variables or functions declared in a namespace are accessible within the namespace and 
outside of it using a `using` statement or the `::` operator.

```cpp
// Copyright 2024 CSCE240
#include <iostream>
using std::cout;
using std::endl;

namespace csce240 {
int var = 42;
}

using csce240::var;  // Access var directly

int main() {
  cout << var << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

## Unary Scope Resolution Operator

The *unary scope resolution operator* (`::`) is used to access a variable declared outside of a block, 
even if a variable with the same name is declared within the block. By preceding the variable name 
with `::`, you can refer to the variable in the outer scope, bypassing the local declaration.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using std::cout;

int x = 1;  // Global variable

int main() {
  int x = 5;  // Local variable in main
  cout << x << "\n";   // Prints the local x (5)
  cout << ::x << "\n"; // Prints the global x (1)
  return 0;
}
