To create truly reusable functions, their implementations need to be written 
in a separate file that does not contain a `main` function. This approach, known 
as **separate compilation**, allows you to organize your project into multiple 
files, making it easier to manage, test, and reuse your code. By combining a 
`makefile`, header files, source files, and a driver, you can build modular 
and scalable C++ projects.

## Header File

A *header file* (`.h`) is used to **declare function prototypes**, **class definitions**, 
**and other shared components**, allowing them to be included in multiple C++ files. 
By placing your function prototypes in a header file, you enable other source 
files to access and use those functions without redefining them.

### Key Points

- **Reusable Prototypes**: Placing function prototypes in a header file makes 
them accessible to multiple source files within a project.

- **Header Guards**: To prevent multiple inclusions of the same header file, use *header guards*. 
These ensure that the contents of the header file are included only once during compilation:

```cpp title="program.h"
// Copyright 2024 CSCE240
#ifndef PROJECT_PATH_FILENAME_H_
#define PROJECT_PATH_FILENAME_H_

// Function prototypes here
int aFunction(int, int);
void anotherFunction();

#endif
```

<Aside title="Header Guards">You can think of those statements like: "if not defined," then "define this header", finally "end my if statement"</Aside>

## Source File

A source file (`.cc`) contains the **actual implementation of your functions and 
includes the corresponding header file for the function prototypes**. This 
structure allows for clean separation of declarations and implementations, 
enhancing modularity and reusability in your code.

### Key Points

- **Including the Header File**: The source file begins by including the header file that 
declares the function prototypes. This ensures that the implementation matches the declarations.

```cpp title="source.cc"
// Copyright 2024 CSCE240
#include "header.h"

int aFunction(int x, int y) {
  // Do something
}

void anotherFunction() {
  // Do something
}
```

- **Compiling the Source File**: Use the `g++ -c` command to compile the source file into an object file (`.o`). 
For example, the following would generate a `source.o` file:

```shell
g++ -Wall -std=c++17 -c source.cc
```

- **Linking Object Files**: The object code can be linked with other object files and a driver file to create an executable. 
For example:

```shell
g++ -Wall -std=c++17 source.o driver.o -o executable
```

<Aside>
Now that we are separating code into different files we'll finally start utilizing a `makefile`. 
If you need to review makefiles, [you can view the reference page](../syntax/makefile.mdx).
</Aside>

## Example

Lets take the previous Calculator program from the [Writing and Using page](./writing-and-using#example) and properly separate it into different files.

### Header File

Create a file called `calculator.h` and add the function prototypes:

<Code title="calculator.h" lang="cpp" code={code.header} />

Checking the file with `cpplint` will throw the following error:

```shell
cpplint calculator.h
calculator.h:3: #ifndef header guard has wrong style, please use: FILE_PATH  [build/header_guard] [5]
calculator.h:14: #endif line should be "#endif  // FILE_PATH"  [build/header_guard] [5]
```

<Aside>
This is the first case where a `cpplint` error can be disregarded. `cpplint` is basically asking you 
to use a complete file path instead of a relative one after `ifndef` and asking you to include 
a complete file path after `#endif`.
</Aside>

### Source File

Now create a file called `calculator.cc` and add the implementation for each function:

<Code title="calculator.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.source} />

Again, running `cpplint` will throw the following error: 

```shell
cpplint calculator.cc
calculator.cc:3:  Include the directory when naming header files  [build/include_subdir] [4]
```

<Aside>
This is another case where `cpplint` can be disregarded as it is asking you to include a complete 
file path after `#include` instead of a relative one.
</Aside>

### Driver File

The Driver will contain our `main` function so create a file called `driver.cc` and add what your program does: 

<Code title="driver.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.driver} />

<Aside>`cpplint` will again throw a false error since we're using `#include` with a relative file path.</Aside>

### Makefile

The final file to create is a `makefile`. Not using one becomes incredibly tedious as we would have to compile and 
link various files. Add the following code to your `makefile`: 

<Code title="driver.cc" lang="makefile" code={code.makefile} />

<Aside>
Remember that when copying the `makefile` code snippet that some code editors don't recognize tabs. Use `backspace` 
to reset each recipe line then enter `tab` to give them the proper indentation. The following error is thrown when this is 
the case:

<Code lang="shell" code={errors.makefileError}/>
</Aside>

### Compile, Link, & Run

Now that we created a `makefile` we can compile, link, and run our calculator program. Though the `makefile` shows many 
commands, we only have to run the `driver` script to accomplish everything!

<Code lang="bash" code={code.run} mark={[1, 16, 18, 20, 29]} />
