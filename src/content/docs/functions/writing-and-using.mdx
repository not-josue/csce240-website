Functions are an essential part of **writing organized and 
maintainable C++ programs**. They allow you to delegate tasks, 
making your code easier to test, reuse, and extend. In this 
page, you'll learn why functions are important, how to write 
and use them, and where they can be defined in your projects.

## Why

Functions are a key tool for **improving the structure and efficiency** 
of your programs. Using functions promotes cleaner, more modular code, 
making your programs more efficient and easier to debug.

- **Delegation of Tasks**: Functions allow you to break down complex problems 
into smaller, manageable tasks. Each function performs a specific job, 
making your code easier to understand and maintain.

- **Ease of Testing**: By isolating tasks into functions, you can test them 
independently to ensure they work correctly before integrating them into your program.

- **Reusability**: Functions can be reused across different parts of your program 
or even in future projects, saving time and effort.

- **DRY Principle**: Functions help you adhere to the **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)** 
principle by consolidating repetitive code into a single function, reducing 
redundancy and the chance of errors.

## How

Writing and using functions in C++ involves a few straightforward steps:

import { Code, TabItem, Tabs, Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { code } from "@ts/functions/writing";

<Steps>

1. **Create the Prototype**: Define the function's return type, name, and parameter list at the 
beginning of your program or in a header file. This tells the compiler what the function looks 
like before its implementation.

    ```cpp
    int GetMin(int, int);
    ```

2. **Write the Implementation**: Provide the actual code for the function, specifying how it performs 
its task. This is usually done after the main function or in a separate source file.

    ```cpp
    int GetMin(int x, int y) { return x <= y ? x : y; }
    ```

3. **Test It (Call It)**: Call the function from your main function or another part of your program 
to test its behavior and ensure it works as expected.
