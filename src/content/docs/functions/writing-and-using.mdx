Functions are an essential part of **writing organized and 
maintainable C++ programs**. They allow you to delegate tasks, 
making your code easier to test, reuse, and extend. In this 
page, you'll learn why functions are important, how to write 
and use them, and where they can be defined in your projects.

## Why

Functions are a key tool for **improving the structure and efficiency** 
of your programs. Using functions promotes cleaner, more modular code, 
making your programs more efficient and easier to debug.

- **Delegation of Tasks**: Functions allow you to break down complex problems 
into smaller, manageable tasks. Each function performs a specific job, 
making your code easier to understand and maintain.

- **Ease of Testing**: By isolating tasks into functions, you can test them 
independently to ensure they work correctly before integrating them into your program.

- **Reusability**: Functions can be reused across different parts of your program 
or even in future projects, saving time and effort.

- **DRY Principle**: Functions help you adhere to the **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)** 
principle by consolidating repetitive code into a single function, reducing 
redundancy and the chance of errors.

## How

Writing and using functions in C++ involves a few straightforward steps:

import { Aside, Code, TabItem, Tabs, Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { code } from "@ts/functions/writing";

<Steps>

1. **Create the Prototype**: Define the function's return type, name, and parameter list at the 
beginning of your program or in a header file. This tells the compiler what the function looks 
like before its implementation.

    ```cpp
    int GetMin(int, int);
    ```

2. **Write the Implementation**: Provide the actual code for the function, specifying how it performs 
its task. This is usually done after the main function or in a separate source file.

    ```cpp
    int GetMin(int x, int y) { return x <= y ? x : y; }
    ```

3. **Test It (Call It)**: Call the function from your main function or another part of your program 
to test its behavior and ensure it works as expected.

        <TabItem label="Driver" icon="rocket">
            <Code title="driver.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.howExample} />
        </TabItem>

        <TabItem label="Terminal" icon="laptop">
            <Code lang="bash" code={code.howTerminal} mark={[1, 3, 4]} />
        </TabItem>

    </Tabs>

</Steps>

## Where

Functions can be written in various locations depending on the structure of your program and how you plan to use them.

**In the Driver with main**: When starting out, you'll typically write your functions in the same source file as your 
`main` function. This keeps everything in one place, making it easier to learn and test.

**In Separate Source Files**: Functions can also be written in separate source files without a `main` function. These files 
can be compiled individually and linked into larger projects. This approach is useful for organizing code in larger programs.

**In Header Files**: Functions can be declared in header files and implemented in source files. This allows you to reuse them 
across multiple projects by simply including the header file.

<Aside>
You may have an assignment where all your code goes in a single file which is why we're going to cover using separate files in a future lesson.

## The Prototype

A function's prototype is a declaration that specifies the structure of a function, including its name, return type, and parameter list. 
It **serves as a promise to the compiler that the function will be implemented later** in the program.

### Key Points

- **Single Statement**: A prototype is a single statement and must end with a semicolon (`;`). For example:

```cpp
int Multiply(int x, int y);
```

- **Optional Parameter Names**: Naming the parameters in the prototype is optional, but including them can improve readability:

```cpp
int Add(int, int);  // Valid
int Add(int a, int b);  // Also valid and more descriptive
```

**Placement**: Prototypes should not appear inside the body of any other function. They must also precede all calls to the function, either 
at the top of the source file or in a header file.

## The Implementation

The implementation of a function provides the full definition, including how it performs its task. It consists of two main parts:

1. **The Function Header**: Specifies the return type, function name, and parameter list.

2. **The Function Body**: Contains the C++ commands enclosed in braces ({}) that define the function's behavior.

### Key Points

- **Named Parameters**: Parameters must be named in the function header so they can be referenced within the function body. 
These parameters are local to the function, meaning they cannot be accessed outside of it.

```cpp
int Add(int a, int b) {  // 'a' and 'b' are local to this function
  return a + b;
}
```

- **No Semicolon**: There is no semicolon between the function header and the opening brace of the body.

- **Separate Implementations**: Each function must be implemented independently. One function cannot be implemented 
inside the body of another function.

## Example

Lets create a calculator program that allows a user to add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers they enter.

<Steps>

1. ### Setup File

    - We'll create a document called `driver.cc`, copyright the document, and create our `main` function.

    - We want to print to the terminal and take user input so we'll `#include` the `<iostream>` class and use 
    the `cin`, `cout`, and `endl` objects

    <Code title="driver.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.exampleSetup} />

2. ### Create Function Prototypes

    - We want to great the user when the program is first run.

    - Lets give the user the ability to add, subtract, multiply, divide, and square integers they enter.

    <Code title="driver.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.exampleProto} />

3. ### Write Implementation

    - Below our `main` function, we'll code the implementation of our functions.

    - We'll assume for this exercise that user input is **ALWAYS** correct.

    <Code title="driver.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.exampleImp} />

4. ### Test Functions

    - Lets write a couple of tests in our `main` function to check the implementation of our functions.

    - Then we'll check our styles and run the program.

    <Tabs>

        <TabItem label="Driver" icon="rocket">
            <Code title="driver.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.exampleTest1} />
        </TabItem>

        <TabItem label="Terminal" icon="laptop">
            <Code lang="bash" code={code.exampleTerm1} mark={[1, 3, 4]}/>
        </TabItem>

    </Tabs>

    - `Divide()` is a little different than the rest of the functions, so we'll call it a couple 
    of times to see its output

    - Finally we'll recompile our program and run it to see the results.

    <Tabs>

        <TabItem label="Driver" icon="rocket">
            <Code title="driver.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.exampleTest2} />
        </TabItem>

        <TabItem label="Terminal" icon="laptop">
            <Code lang="bash" code={code.exampleTerm2} mark={[1, 2]}/>
        </TabItem>

    </Tabs>

5. ### Create FrontEnd

    - We need to print a message for the user to notify them which options they have.

    - Lets declare another function prototype and add it to the others.

    ```cpp title="driver.cc"
    void FrontEnd();
    ```

    - Now we need to write its implementation.

    ```cpp title="driver.cc"
    void FrontEnd() {
      cout << "Enter 1: To Add" << endl;
      cout << "Enter 2: To Subtract" << endl;
      cout << "Enter 3: To Multiply" << endl;
      cout << "Enter 4: To Divide" << endl;
      cout << "Enter 5: To Square" << endl;
      cout << "Enter 0: To Quit" << endl;
    }
    ```

    - This FrontEnd should remind you of the many programs written in CSCE146. What we 
    are going to do is:

        1. Wrapping our code in a `while` loop.

        2. Printing options to the user -> await input.

        3. Direct that input to match a case in a `switch` statement.

        4. Get the required input to fulfill the requirements of that operation.

        5. Print an output.

        6. Repeat until the user quits the program.

    - This is the final version of our `main` function:

    <Code title="driver.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.exampleFeLast} />

6. ### Run and Test

    - Finally we can run our program and test different inputs to see how it runs.

    - Instead of showing one long terminal log, I've parsed the output for each test:

    #### Check Style, Compile, & Run

    <Code lang="bash" code={code.outputStart} mark={[1, 3, 4]}/>

    #### Wrong Option Route

    <Code lang="bash" code={code.outputWrongOption} mark={[11]}/>

    #### Addition Route

    <Code lang="bash" code={code.outputAdd} mark={[7, 9, 11]}/>

    #### Subtraction Route

    <Code lang="bash" code={code.outputSub} mark={[7, 9, 11]}/>

    #### Multiplication Route

    <Code lang="bash" code={code.outputMul} mark={[7, 9, 11]}/>

    #### Division Route

    <Code lang="bash" code={code.outputDiv} mark={[7, 9, 11]}/>

    #### Squaring Route

    <Code lang="bash" code={code.outputSquare} mark={[7, 9]}/>

    #### Quitting Route

    <Code lang="bash" code={code.outputQuit} mark={[7]}/>

</Steps>
