A function in C++ is a **list of instructions designed to perform a 
specific task**. Functions help organize your code, making it easier 
to read, maintain, and reuse. For example, the `main` function, which 
you've already encountered, is the entry point of every C++ program.

## Terminology

This section introduces the terms and concepts you'll frequently encounter 
when working with functions in C++, along with examples to illustrate their use.

### Arguments

*Arguments* are the **values sent to a function when it is called**. These 
values are used by the function to perform its task. For example, the 
main functions you've written so far have taken no arguments, as shown below:

```cpp title="driver.cc"
int main() {
  // No arguments passed to main
  return 0;
}
```

However, functions can accept arguments to process specific data. For instance:

```cpp
void PrintNumber(int x) { cout << x << endl; }
```

### Call

*Calling* a function means executing it by passing the required *arguments*. This *invokes* the function's code.

```cpp
int main() {
  cout << "Enter a number to square: " << endl;
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  cout << n << " squared = " << Square(n) << endl; // Calling the Square function
}
```

### Implementation

The *definition* or *implementation* of a function is the complete code of the function, 
including the body that specifies what the function does.

```cpp
char GetLetter(int n) {
  // Implementation of GetLetter()
  if (n <= 1 || n > 26) return 'a';
  return 'a' + (n - 1) % 26;
}
```

### Name

The *name* of a function is its identifier, **used to call or reference the function**
in code. It must be unique within the same scope.

```cpp
// Add is the name
int Add(int x, int y) { return x + y; }

// Greet is the name
void Greet() { cout << "Hello World" << endl; }
```

### Parameters

*Parameters* are the **variables listed in the function definition that receive values 
when the function is called**. They are like placeholders for the *arguments* passed to the function.

```cpp
// x and y are the parameters
int Add(int x, int y) { return x + y; }
```

### Prototype

The function *prototype* is a declaration of a function that **specifies the return type**, **name**, 
**and parameters but without the body**. It informs the compiler about the function before its actual definition.

Function prototypes are found either above the `main` function or in a `header` file.

```cpp
int Subtract(int x, int y);
```

### Return Type

The *return type* of a function specifies **the type of value the function returns after execution**. 
If a function doesn't return any value, the return type is `void`.

```cpp
// int is the return type
int Max(int x, int y) { return x > y ? x : y; }
// no return type
void ProductInfo() { cout << "Name:\nCategory:\nPrice:\nItem #:" << endl; }
```

### Signature

A function's *signature* consists of the **function's name and its parameter types 
(but not the return type)**. It uniquely identifies a function.

```cpp
// int and int are the signatures
int Multiply(int x, int y);
```
