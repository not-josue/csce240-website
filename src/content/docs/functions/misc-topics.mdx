This page covers a variety of important C++ topics that expand your understanding 
of functions and their capabilities. You'll learn about **parameter passing methods**, 
including **call by value** and **call by reference**, as well as explore the concepts of 
**recursive functions**, **function overloading**, and **default arguments**.

## Parameter Passing Methods

In C++, functions can receive arguments through different methods, which determine how 
changes to the arguments are handled:

- **Call-by-Value**: A copy of the value is sent to the function. Any changes made to the 
function's parameter **do not affect the original variable** outside the function.

- **Call-by-Reference**: A reference to the original variable is sent to the function. 
Changes made to the parameter directly **modify the variable passed** in the function call.

### Relative Advantages

**Call-by-Value**:

- **Independence**: Functions are completely independent of the calling code since they work 
with a copy of the data. Changes inside the function do not affect the original variables.

- **Flexibility**: You can pass either variables or literal values as arguments, making it 
versatile for scenarios where the function doesn't need to modify the original data.

**Call-by-Reference**:

- **Efficiency**: Passing a reference avoids creating a copy of the data, saving memory and 
processing time, especially for large objects or arrays.

- **Mutability**: It allows a function to directly update multiple variables in the calling 
code, making it useful for tasks like swapping values or accumulating results.

### Example

To create a reference parameter, use the `&` symbol before a parameter in the function's parameter list. 
This tells the compiler to pass the argument by reference.

The following function swaps the values of two variables:

```cpp title="driver.cc"
// Copyright 2024 CSCE240

#include <iostream>

using std::cout;
using std::endl;

void Swap(int &a, int &b) {
  int temp = a;
  a = b;
  b = temp;
}

int main() {
  int a = 5, b = 10;

  Swap(a, b);

  cout << a << endl;  // 10
  cout << b << endl;  // 5

  return 0;
}
```

## Recursive Functions

A *recursive function* is a function that **calls itself as part of its execution**. 
This approach allows problems to be broken down into smaller, simpler subproblems, 
which the function solves recursively.

For a recursive function to terminate, it must:

1. Include a **base case**, which is a condition where the recursion stops.

2. Call “simpler” versions of itself, reducing the problem size in each step (the **inductive step**).

### Example

To better understand how recursive functions work, let's look at an example. In this 
section, we'll implement a recursive function to calculate Fibonacci numbers, 
demonstrating the base cases and inductive step required for recursion.

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the 
two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. The sequence begins as 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 
5, 8, and so on, growing indefinitely.

```cpp title="driver.cc"
// Copyright 2024 CSCE240

#include <iostream>

using std::cout;
using std::endl;

// Recursive function to calculate Fibonacci numbers
// The Fibonacci sequence starts as 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8...
int Fibo(int a) {
  // Base Cases: Stop recursion when a is 0 or 1
  if (a <= 0) return 0;
  if (a == 1) return 1;
  // Inductive Step: Calculate Fibo(a - 1) + Fibo(a - 2)
  return Fibo(a - 1) + Fibo(a - 2);
}

int main() {
  // Test cases
  cout << Fibo(0) << endl;  // 0
  cout << Fibo(1) << endl;  // 1
  cout << Fibo(2) << endl;  // 1
  cout << Fibo(3) << endl;  // 2
  cout << Fibo(4) << endl;  // 3

  // Note: This recursive implementation is not efficient for large inputs
  return 0;
}
```

## Overloading Functions

In C++, you can write multiple functions with the same name as long as their 
**parameter lists are distinct**, **either by the type or the number of parameters**. 
This concept, known as *function overloading*, allows you to create flexible 
functions that handle different types or quantities of input without needing 
unique names for each variation.

<Aside>
The `cout` object in C++ is a practical example of function overloading. 
It uses multiple overloaded versions of the stream insertion operator 
(`<<`) to handle different types of data.

### Example

The following example shows an overloaded function that returns the largest number 
out of the two arguments:

```cpp title="driver.cc"
// Copyright 2024 CSCE240

#include <iostream>

using std::cout;
using std::endl;

int GetMax(int x, int y) { return x > y ? x : y; }

// Overloaded
double GetMax(double x, double y) { return x > y ? x : y; }

int main() {
  cout << GetMax(4, 5) << endl;      // 5
  cout << GetMax(4.5, 6.5) << endl;  // 6.5

  return 0;
}
```

## Default Arguments

Default arguments allow you to make your functions more versatile by **assigning 
default values to parameters** in the function prototype. These defaults are **used 
if the function is called with fewer arguments** than specified in the parameter list.

### Key Points

- **Prototype Placement**: Assign default values directly in the function prototype, 
not in the function implementation.

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
int Add(int x, int y = 0);
```

- **Order Matters**: Default arguments must be assigned from right to left in the parameter 
list. Parameters without default values should appear first, while those with defaults 
should come at the end.

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
int Multiply(int a, int b, int c = 1, int d = 1);
```

- **Avoid Ambiguity**: Ensure your default arguments don't create confusion with overloaded functions, 
as this can lead to errors during compilation. The following functions will cause confusion: 

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
int Max(int, int, int = 0, int = 0);
int Max(int, int);
```
