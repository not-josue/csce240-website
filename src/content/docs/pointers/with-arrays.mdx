Pointers and arrays are closely related in C++. 
When you use a pointer to reference an array, the 
**pointer effectively points to the array's first element**.

Once you have a pointer to the start of an array, you can 
use **pointer arithmetic to move through it**, or even use the 
subscript operator (`[]`) just like you would with a normal 
array.

## Decaying Arrays

Unlike regular variables, you typically don't use the reference
operator (`&`) to obtain the address of an array. In most contexts, 
the **name of an array already decays into a pointer to its first 
element**. This means that writing something like:

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
const int kSize = 5;
int array[kSize] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
int *ptr = array;
```

is sufficient to give `ptr` the starting address of the array. You 
don't need to write `&arr[0]` (though it's valid) because using the 
array's name by itself inherently provides the address of its first element.

## Pointer Arithmetic

In C++, **pointer arithmetic allows you to move through an array without 
explicitly using indices**. Since an array name “decays” to a pointer 
that points to its first element, you can increment, decrement, or 
add integer values to the pointer to change which element it references.

- **Incrementing a Pointer** (`ptr++`): Moves the pointer to the next element in the array.

- **Decrementing a Pointer** (`ptr--`): Moves the pointer to the previous element in the array.

Here's an example illustrating pointer arithmetic with an array:

```cpp title="driver.cc"
#include <iostream>
using std::cout;
using std::endl;

int main() {
  const int kSize = 5;
  int array[kSize] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
  int *ptr = array;  // ptr points to array[0]

  // Print all elements using subscript notation on the pointer
  for (int i = 0; i < kSize; ++i) {
    cout << ptr[i] << endl;
  }

  // Move the pointer forward two positions
  ++ptr;  // Now ptr points to array[1]
  ++ptr;  // Now ptr points to array[2]

  // Dereference ptr to get the current element
  cout << *ptr << endl;  // Prints 3

  return 0;
}
```

## Array Of Pointers

Since arrays can store any type of elements, including pointers, 
it's perfectly valid to create an array of pointers. For example:

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
int *x[5]; // Declares an array of 5 pointers to integers
```

In this declaration, each element of `x` is a pointer to an `int`. 
This can be useful in scenarios where you need to manage a list 
of dynamically allocated memory blocks, or when you're storing a 
list of words (C-style strings) as pointers to `char`, rather than 
using a two-dimensional array.

## New And Delete

In C++, you can allocate memory at run-time rather than at compile-time. 
This approach is known as **dynamic memory allocation**, and it allows you 
to **create arrays whose size isn't known until the program is running**. 
To achieve this flexibility, C++ provides two key operators: `new` and `delete`.

- `new` **Operator**:
Allocates memory on the heap and returns a pointer to the newly allocated space. 
If the allocation fails, it returns `nullptr`.

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
int *arr = new int[10]; // Allocates space for 10 ints
if (arr == nullptr) {
    // Handle allocation failure
}
```

- `delete` **Operator**:
Frees the memory previously allocated by `new`. When freeing arrays, use `delete[]` 
followed by the pointer name. This ensures that the correct amount of memory is released.

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
delete[] arr; // Frees the array allocated by new
arr = nullptr; // Good practice to set the pointer to nullptr after deleting
```

### Resizing An Array Dynamically

Standard arrays have a fixed size, but you can simulate “resizing” by allocating a new, 
larger array and then copying the old elements over before deleting the old array:

```cpp title="driver.cc"
#include <iostream>
using std::cout;
using std::endl;

int main() {
  const int kSize = 5;
  int *array = new int[kSize]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

  //  doubling the size is common
  const int kNewSize = kSize * 2;
  int *temp = new int[kNewSize];

  //  iterate and fill temp
  for (int i = 0; i < kSize; ++i) {
    temp[i] = array[i];
  }

  delete[] array;
  array = temp;

  //  remaining elements are 0
  for (int i = 0; i < kNewSize; ++i) {
    cout << array[i] << " ";
  }
  cout << endl;

  //  you can clean up at the end of your program
  delete[] array;
  array = nullptr;

  return 0;
}
```

The program produces the following output:

```bash mark={1, 2}
g++ -Wall -std=c++17 driver.cc
./a.out
1 2 3 4 5 0 0 0 0 0
```
