Using a pointer as a function parameter offers the **same advantages 
as using call-by-reference parameters**. By passing the address of a 
variable, you can modify its value directly within the function, 
saving space and allowing the caller's data to be changed without 
returning a new value. For example:

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
int Square(int *x) {
  *x *= *x;  // Modify the value at the pointer's address
  return *x;
}

//  Square(&variable) <- remember reference operator
```

Here, `x` is a pointer to an integer. Calling `Square(&num)` will modify `num` in place.

<Aside>
When using arrays as arguments, you can **just use the array name** since it will decay into a pointer.

In CSCE240, **most functions with pointers as parameters will likely involve arrays** so you 
may not run into a case where you have to remember to call a function using the reference operator before the variable.

## Why Point Over Reference

While call-by-reference (using references) and call-by-pointer (using pointers) 
both allow in-place modifications, pointers offer more flexibility. For instance, 
you can:

- **Reassign Pointers**: Change what a pointer points to at runtime, allowing dynamic 
behavior not possible with a simple reference.

- **Work With Dynamically Allocated Memory**: Allocate, deallocate, and manage memory on the fly.

## Example

As mentioned in the [Algorithms Page](../arrays/algorithms#mergesort), lets refactor the `MergeSort` algorithm 
using what we've learned about pointers. We'll also create a new `Print` function with a pointer to test the 
function.

<Steps>

1. **Create Driver File**

    Create a file called `driver.cc`. We'll be making everything in one file since we're only 
    implementing a couple of functions:

    <Code title="driver.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.step1} />

2. **Add Function Implementation**

    Under the `main` function, lets first add the implementation for the primary function that will be called, `MergeSort`. 
    Highlighted are the newly added or changed lines:

    <Code title="driver.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.step2MergeSort} ins={[1, 13, 14, 34, 35]}  />

    Next we'll add the implementation for `Merge`, the helper function:

    <Code title="driver.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.step2Merge} ins={[1, 2]} />

    Finally, let's add the implementation for the `Print` function:

    <Code title="driver.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.step2Print} ins={[1]} />

3. **Test Functions**

    The last step is to test all the functions we've created:

    <Code title="driver.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.step3} mark={[1, 2]} />

</Steps>
