`make` is a utility that helps **keep your object code and executable 
files up-to-date**. It **automates the compilation** process by checking 
dependencies and only recompiling files that have changed.

The `make` utility looks for a file named `makefile` (or `Makefile`) 
in the current directory, which contains the rules you've written 
to define how your files should be compiled and linked.

## Why Make?

Using a `makefile` simplifies the process of **compiling and linking your 
C++ programs**. Instead of typing long and complex commands every time you 
want to compile your code, a `makefile` allows you to automate the process 
with a **single, simple command**. This becomes especially useful as your 
programs grow and involve multiple files, making make an essential tool 
for efficient development.

## Syntax

Makefiles follow a specific syntax to define rules and instructions for 
compiling and linking your programs. In this section, we'll explore the 
basic structure and components, including how to add comments and define rules.

### Commenting

You can make single-line comments in a `makefile` by starting the line 
with a #:

```makefile title="makefile"
# A comment in a makefile
```

### Make Rule

A make rule defines how a specific file (the target) is created or updated. 
It consists of three main parts:

1. **Target:** The file to be created or updated (e.g., an object file or executable).
2. **Prerequisite(s):** The file(s) the target depends on, such as source files or header files.
3. **Recipe Command(s):** The shell commands to generate or update the target.

```makefile title="makefile"
target: Prerequisite(s)
    recipe command(s)
```

import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<Aside>
The line(s) containing recipe command(s) must
begin with a `tab` **NOT** `spaces`.
</Aside>

<Aside type="caution">
Some code editors may **interpret tabs as spaces when copying and pasting recipe commands** 
from code snippets. If you get the following error, **reset the recipe commands to the start 
of the line** with `backspace` and enter `tab`:

```shell
*** missing separator.  Stop.
```
</Aside>

```makefile title="makefile"
hello.o : hello.cc
	g++ -c hello.cc
```

- The rule above says the **target** hello.o is dependent on
the **prerequisite** hello.cc

- When you enter `make hello.o` into the terminal, it will check to see if hello.cc **has
been updated more recently** than hello.o, and if so, the
recipe command will execute:

```bash
make hello.o
g++ -c hello.cc
```

### Flags

Flags are options passed to the compiler to control how your program is compiled. 
In this course, the following flags will be used:

- `-Wall`: Enables most compiler warnings, helping you identify potential issues in your code.
- `-std=c++17`: Specifies that the program should be compiled using the C++17 standard.

Lets update the `makefile` to include these flags:

```makefile title="makefile"
hello.o : hello.cc
    g++ -c -Wall -std=c++17 hello.cc
```

### Multiple Rules

Makefiles allow you to **define multiple rules**, **each with specific commands**, 
to handle different parts of the compilation process. For example, you can 
create separate rules to compile individual source files, link them into an 
executable, and even ðŸš€ run the program.

The following updates the makefile to compile, link, and execute a program:

import { Code, Steps ,TabItem, Tabs } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { code } from "@ts/syntax/makefile";

<Tabs>

<TabItem label="Makefile" icon="seti:makefile">
    <Code title="makefile" lang="makefile" code={code.multiRuleMake} />
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Source" icon="seti:cpp">
    <Code title="hello.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.multiRuleSource} />
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Terminal" icon="laptop">
    <Code lang="bash" code={code.multiRuleTerminal} />
</TabItem>

</Tabs>

<Steps>

1. `make hello` will first examine the rule for prerequisite hello.o, and run the recipe
`g++ -c -Wall -std=c++17 hello.cc`

2. Then it will check if `hello.o` has been updated more recently than the
executable `hello` and, if so, the recipe below will execute
`g++ -Wall -std=c++17 hello.o -o hello`

3. Finally it will run the command to execute the `hello` program `./hello`

</Steps>

### Variables

Variables in makefiles are useful for **reducing repetition and minimizing the 
chance of errors**. Instead of typing out long commands or file names multiple 
times, you can define them once as a variable and **reuse them** throughout your 
`makefile`.

The following is the basic syntax:

```makefile title="makefile"
# Define
variable_name = value
# Use Variable
$(variable_name)
```

The following are common variables found in the course:

```makefile title="makefile"
compiler = g++
flags = -Wall -std=c++17
compile = $(compiler) -c
link = $(compiler) $(flags) -o $@
```

Makefiles include several built-in variables that can simplify your 
commands by automatically referring to parts of a rule:

- `$<`: Represents the first prerequisite in the rule.
- `$^`: Represents all prerequisites in the rule.
- `$@`: Represents the target of the rule.

Lets update the makefile we've been working on with variables:

```makefile title="makefile"
# Variables
compiler = g++
flags = -Wall -std=c++17
compile = $(compiler) $(flags) -c
link = $(compiler) $(flags)

# Compile
hello.o : hello.cc
    $(compile) $<

# Link
hello : hello.o
    $(link) $^ -o $@
    ./$@
```

### Clean

A rule you'll encounter in each `makefile` in this course is `clean`. It 
is a rule to **remove all of the object code files**, **executable files,** and 
any other temporary files in the directory.

```makefile title="makefile"
clean :
    rm *.o hello
```

<Aside>
If **no prerequisites are listed**, then recipe commands
will **execute each time** the rule is made. So, `make clean`
will always execute the `rm` command.
</Aside>

What the command is saying is **"remove any files with a** `.o` **extension and any file that is 
called** `hello`**"** which is the name chosen for the executable.

Lets finalize our makefile, update the source code, execute our program, and clean our folder:

<Tabs>

<TabItem label="Makefile" icon="seti:makefile">
    <Code title="makefile" lang="makefile" code={code.cleanMake} />
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Source" icon="seti:cpp">
    <Code title="hello.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.cleanSource} />
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Terminal" icon="laptop">
    <Code lang="bash" code={code.cleanTerminal} mark={[1, 7]} />
</TabItem>

</Tabs>
