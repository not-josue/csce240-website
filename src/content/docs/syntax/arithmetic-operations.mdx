Arithmetic operations are fundamental to programming in C++. 
They allow you to perform calculations such as addition, subtraction, 
multiplication, division, and finding the remainder using the modulus operator. 

## Operators

The symbols for arithmetic operations are the same as the ones you experienced in Java, and they follow 
order of operations (PEMDAS):

- `*`: for multiplication
- `/`: for division
- `%`: modulus operator
- `+`: for addition
- `-`: for subtraction

You can put an arithmetic operation in a `cout` statement: `cout << x + y << endl;`

In C++, the results of arithmetic operations **depend on the data types of the operands**. 
For example, when both operands are integers, the division operator performs **integer division**, 
truncating any decimal portion. This means `1 / 4` evaluates to `0`. 

However, if at least one operand 
is a floating-point number, the division operator performs **floating-point division**, preserving the decimal result. 
For instance, `1 / 4.0` and `1.0 / 4` both evaluate to `0.25`. 

## Compound Assignment Operators

Compound assignment operators are shortcuts that **combine arithmetic operations with assignment**. 
Instead of writing `x = x + 5`, you can use `x += 5` to achieve the same result in a more concise way. 
These operators save time and make your code easier to read while performing the same calculations.

| Type | Shortcut | Equivalence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Addition | `x += y` | `x = x + y` |
| Subtraction | `x -= y` | `x = x - y` |
| Multiplication | `x *= y` | `x = x * y` |
| Division | `x /= y` | `x = x / y` |
| Modulus | `x %= y` | `x = x % y` |

## Increment and Decrement Operators

Increment (`++`) and decrement (`--`) operators are used to **increase or decrease the 
value of a variable by one**. These operators are commonly used in loops, counters, 
and other situations where a variable needs to be adjusted step by step.

### Pre-Operations

When the increment (`++`) or decrement (`--`) operator precedes a variable, it is called **pre-increment** 
or **pre-decrement**. In this case, the operation is performed first, and the updated 
value of the variable is returned immediately.

```cpp
int x = 5;
int y = ++x // x is incremented to 6, and y is assigned the value of 6
```

### Post-Operations

When the increment (`++`) or decrement (`--`) operator follows a variable, it is called 
**post-increment** or **post-decrement**, respectively. In this case, the operation uses the 
current value of the variable first, and then the variable is updated.

```cpp
int x = 5;
int y = x++;  // y is assigned the value 5, and then x is incremented to 6
```

### More Examples 

```cpp
int x = 3, y;
y = ++x + 2;
cout << x << " " << y;
// Output: 4 6
```

```cpp
int x = 3, y;
y = x++ + 2;
cout << x << “ “ << y;
// Output: 4 5
```

## Type Casting

In C++, when performing arithmetic operations involving both integer and real 
(floating-point) variables, the integer variable is **implicitly type cast** to a 
real variable. This ensures that the operation is carried out in floating-point 
precision rather than integer precision.

```cpp
int x = 5;
double y = 2.0;
double result = x / y;  // x is implicitly cast to 5.0, and the result is 2.5
```

This **implicit type casting** ensures accurate results when mixing data types in 
arithmetic operations. However, **explicit type casting** can also be used for 
greater control when needed. For instance:

```cpp
double result = static_cast<double>(x) / y;  // Explicitly cast x to a double
```
