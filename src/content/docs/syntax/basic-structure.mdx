title: Basic Structure
descriptions: Learn the beginning basic structure of a C++ file in CSCE240.
---

Every C++ program follows a basic structure that serves as its foundation. 
This includes **adding comments** to document your code, using **preprocessor 
directives** to set up the program, and writing the **main function** where 
the program's execution begins. 

## Commenting

**Comments** are little notes about your code to remind yourself, or tell other 
developers what your code is doing. Comments are ignored by the compiler, so 
feel free to write as many as you need!

- Single-line comment: `// Comment goes after`

- Multi-line comment: `/* Comment goes in-between */`

## Main Function

The `main` function is the entry point of any C++ program. It's where the program begins 
execution. Every C++ program must have exactly one `main` function, and its structure 
allows the programmer to control the flow of the program. 

You'll write your code inside 
this function, making it the starting place for any task your program performs.
The `main` function will usually be found in a file called `driver.cc`.

import { Aside, Code } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { code } from "@ts/syntax/basic";

<Code title="driver.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.main} />

- `int` is the `return` type of the function

- `main` is the name of the function

- `()` means an empty parameter list for the **main** function

<Aside>The **main** function can also take exactly two parameters `(int, char *)` but you won't see that in this course.</Aside>

- `return 0;` 0 is treated as `false` in C++ and other programming languages so if code reaches all the way to that `return` line 
the main function returns `false` meaning it is **false that the program had any errors**

## Printing To The Console

Before you can print anything to the console, you need to include the `<iostream>` header file using a **preprocessor directive**.

### Preprocessor Directives

**Preprocessor directives** are instructions that are processed before the actual 
compilation of your code begins. They typically start with a # symbol and are 
used to include files or define constants. For example, the directive `#include <iostream>` 
imports the tools needed to use objects like `std::cout` for output and 
`std::cin` for input.

### Namespaces

In C++, libraries like `<iostream>` organize their functionality into a namespace called `std`. 
By specifying `std::cout`, you're telling the compiler you want to use the `cout` object from the 
standard namespace. This avoids potential naming conflicts and keeps your code clear.

<Aside type="danger">
You may run into C++ tutorials that have `using namespace std` at the top of their code snippets. 
This is considered a **bad practice** as you're **importing everything** from the **standard library** instead 
of just the things that you need.
</Aside>

### Operators

In C++, **operators** are special symbols or **keywords** that perform operations on variables and values.

The first operator introduced is the **scope resolution operator** `::`. It is used to **access
members of a namespace or a class**. For example, `std::cout` uses the scope resolution operator 
to specify that `cout` belongs to the `std` (standard) namespace.

Another operator in C++ is the **stream insertion 
operator** `<<`, which is used for output. It works alongside the `cout` object to 
display information on the screen. It's similar to using `System.out.print()` in CSCE145 
and CSCE146 when you were learning Java.

### Example

The following code shows how to bring each concept together and print a value to the console. 
Most files in this course will be structured this way:

<Code title="driver.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.printing}/>

Line 4 allows you to bring `cout` into the **global namespace**, 
letting you use `cout` directly without needing to prepend it 
with `std::`. This makes the code more concise, especially if 
you use `cout` multiple times in your program.

However, if you only need to use `cout` once or prefer not to 
declare it globally, you can reference it directly from the 
**std namespace**, as shown below:

<Code title="driver.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.localCout}/>

## Escape Sequences

In C++, escape sequences are special character combinations that 
let you format output in specific ways. They start with a backslash `\` 
and are used to insert things like new lines, tabs, or special characters 
into your output.

The following is a list of some escape sequences:

- `\n`: Go to the next line
- `\r`: Return to the beginning of the current line
- `\t`: Tab to the next default tab stop
- `\a`: Ring the system bell
- `\\`: Used to output a single backslash ("\\")

<Aside>You'll mostly be seeing `\n` in this course as a way to structure output and not the rest of the **escape sequences**.</Aside>

## Endl Stream Manipulator

The `endl` stream manipulator is used to insert a newline character 
into the output and **flush the output stream**, ensuring that any 
buffered output is immediately written to the console. You can think 
of it like the `System.out.println()` of C++.

Since `endl` is part of the std namespace, you need to reference it with 
`std::endl` unless you've declared it globally with `using std::endl;`. For example:

import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<Tabs>

<TabItem label="Driver" icon="rocket">
    <Code title="driver.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.endl} />
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Terminal" icon="laptop">
    <Code lang="bash" code={code.endlTerminal} mark={[1,2]} />
</TabItem>

</Tabs>

<Aside>**Highlighted** lines in the Terminal tab are the commands **you have to enter in the Terminal**, the rest is what you should get as output.</Aside>
