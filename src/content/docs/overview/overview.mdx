**Hello, USC!** This website was created to support fellow students at the **University of South Carolina** who are currently taking, or planning to 
take, **CSCE240: Advanced Programming Techniques**. Just as **CSCE145** and **CSCE146** have dedicated websites, I felt that **CSCE240** deserved 
one too!
  
In general, I believe that every programming course should have a modern website. I think of this project as a way to help **"Webify"** USC.

## What This Website Is 

This website serves as both a preparation tool for **CSCE240** and a quick reference during the course. Key technical terminology introduced 
in the course is presented with straightforward explanations, often drawing on concepts from **CSCE146**. 
  
You'll also find code snippets which you can copy into your editor, complete with expected terminal outputs for verification. Below are examples 
of 3 files to paste code in, along with the expected terminal output. Don't worry about the code or the filenames, we'll get to that later!

import { Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import { code } from './code';
