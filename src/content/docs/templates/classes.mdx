Template classes provide a way to **create data structures and objects 
that are independent of the data types they hold**. Much like template 
functions, template classes allow you to write the logic for a single, 
generic class without tying it to a specific type.

Like in CSCE146, this approach is used to create container classes—such 
as arrays, vectors, lists, stacks, queues, and strings—that can work 
with any type of element.

You may or may not have an assignment dealing with Template Classes 
but you will probably be asked about them in the Final Exam.

## Syntax

Defining a template class in C++ is conceptually similar to defining a 
template function. You begin with a `template` directive, then declare 
one or more type parameters inside angle brackets:

```cpp title="myclass.h" showLineNumbers=false
template <class T>
class MyClass {
 public:
  void MyFunc() { cout << "hello" << endl; }
  void AnotherFunc() {
    // do something
  }

 private:
  // data members
};
```

<Aside>
Notice how the functions were implemented in the header file. Though there 
are ways to separate function implementation in a separate source file, 
this will not be covered in this tutorial.

### Instantiating A Template Class

To create an object of a template class, specify the type you want to use 
in angle brackets when declaring your object:

```cpp title="driver.cc" showLineNumbers=false
MyClass<int> intObject;
MyClass<std::string> strObject;

intObject.MyFunc();
```

## Example

You may remember creating a Generic Dynamic Array in CSCE146. Lets create one 
for CSCE240 using template classes.

<Steps>

1. **Create Header**

    Create you header file, write your header guards, and import everything you 
    need. This dynamic array will keep track of its current size, and capacity and 
    the class will be defined in a namespace called `csce_240`:

    <Code title="darray.h" lang="cpp" code={code.step1} />

2. **Constructors and Destructor**

    Lets create a constructor for the class. We'll make the initial capacity 10 and 
    double it whenever we need to resize.

    We'll also create a copy constructor and fill the array with the new elements. We 
    also need a destructor since we're using a pointer as a data member:

    <Code title="darray.h" lang="cpp" code={code.step2} />


3. **Accessors and Operator**

    Next we'll define Getters for the size and capacity of the array:

    <Code title="darray.h" lang="cpp" code={code.step3Acc} />

    Since we have a pointer as a data member, we also need to overload the assignment 
    operator:

    <Code title="darray.h" lang="cpp" code={code.step3Op} />

4. **Utility Functions**

    The first utility function to define is a function to print all the elements that were 
    added to the array. We can keep this function public since its especially useful for testing:

    <Code title="darray.h" lang="cpp" code={code.step4Print} />

    We need to implement a way to add elements to the array, but we also have to consider 
    how it will resize. How the array grows is something we can move to the private section 
    of our class. It is a function that should only be called when necessary and an object 
    should not have access to it:

    **Public `Add`**

    <Code title="darray.h" lang="cpp" code={code.step4Add} />

    **Private `Resize`**

    <Code title="darray.h" lang="cpp" code={code.step4Resize} />

5. **Test**

    Create a driver file, include the header file, and use the new class we created. We'll add a 
    couple of elements to an array then print it. We'll then test the copy constructor and the 
    overloaded assignment operator:

    <Tabs>

        <TabItem label="Driver" icon="rocket">
            <Code title="driver.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.step5Test} />
        </TabItem>

        <TabItem label="Terminal" icon="laptop">
            <Code lang="bash" code={code.step5Term} mark={[1, 2]} />
        </TabItem>

    </Tabs>

</Steps>
