Template functions allow you to write **code that works with 
multiple data types** without having to rewrite the same logic repeatedly. 
They'll remind you of Generics from Java in CSCE146. They let you define 
a single function, and the **compiler will generate type-specific versions 
of that function** for the data types you use.

<Aside>
You may or may not get any assignments using Template Functions but this subject 
may appear on the Final Exam.

## Syntax

To define a template function, you use the `template` keyword followed 
by a template parameter list enclosed in angle brackets. Each template 
parameter is introduced by `typename` (or `class`) to indicate that it's a 
type parameter. For example:

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
template <typename T>
T Add(T a, T b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

From the example:

- `template<typename T>` indicates that `T` is a placeholder type, which the 
compiler will deduce from the arguments you pass.

- `Add` is defined once, but can be used with any type that supports the `+` operator 
(e.g., `int`, `double`, or even user-defined classes if they implement the necessary operator).

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
int result1 = Add(1, 2);
double result2 = Add(1.5, 2.5);
```

<Aside>
You don't have to use `T` if you don't want to but it is a very common placeholder 
that you should be familiar with from CSCE146.

## Example Functions

Good candidates for template functions include **common array-based 
algorithms and utility functions where the logic doesn't depend on 
a specific data type**. For instance, you can create a template function 
that prints the contents of an array, or one that reverses an array, 
making them work seamlessly with arrays of `int`, `double`, `char`, or 
any other type you needâ€”without rewriting the entire function.

<Steps>

1. **Create Driver**

    Create your driver file, import what you need, and declare your template 
    functions. Unfortunately, we have to declare `template <typename T>` for each 
    function:

    <Code title="driver.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.step1} />

2. **Define Implementation**

    Under the `main` function, write the implementation for each function. 
    Again, we have to use `template <typename T>` for each function.

    The first function is our `Print` function:

    <Code title="driver.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.step2Print} />

    The next function is the utility function for swapping elements in an array:

    <Code title="driver.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.step2Swap} />

    The final function to define is `Reverse` which will change the position of 
    all elements in an array (except the middle element in arrays which are oddly sized):

    <Code title="driver.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.step2Reverse} />

3. **Test Functions**

    Now its time to see if we've defined our functions correctly:

    <Tabs>

        <TabItem label="Driver" icon="rocket">
            <Code title="driver.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.step3Main} />
        </TabItem>

        <TabItem label="Terminal" icon="laptop">
            <Code lang="bash" code={code.step3Term} mark={[1, 2]} />
        </TabItem>

    </Tabs>

    <Aside>
    We call the `char` array differently since the last element is the null terminator `\0` 
    which we don't want to swap.
    </Aside>
