This page provides clear definitions of the technical terminology used throughout the course.
Use this reference as a quick guide to reinforce your understanding of the language and ideas introduced in the course.

## `Identifier`

An **identifier** is the name used to **represent variables, functions, arrays, or other 
user-defined elements** in a C++ program. It must begin with a letter or an underscore 
(_) and can be followed by letters, digits, or underscores. Identifiers cannot use 
reserved keywords or contain spaces or special characters. They help make your code 
readable and meaningful.

## `Namespace`

A **namespace** is a **container that organizes identifiers, such as variables, functions, 
and classes, to avoid naming conflicts** in larger programs. In C++, the standard 
library uses the `std` namespace to group its functionality. For example, `std::cout` 
specifies the `cout` object from the `std` namespace. Using namespaces ensures clarity 
and prevents collisions between identifiers with the same name.

## `Operator`

An **operator** is **a symbol or keyword in C++ that performs a specific operation on one or 
more operands**. Operators are used for tasks such as arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), comparisons 
(`==`, `<`, `>`), and logical operations (`&&`, `||`, `!`). They allow you to manipulate data and 
control program logic efficiently.

## `Preprocessor Directives`

**Preprocessor directives** are **instructions that are executed by the C++ preprocessor before the 
actual compilation of the program begins**. They typically start with the `#` symbol and are used for 
tasks such as including header files (`#include`), defining constants (`#define`), or conditional 
compilation (`#ifndef`). These directives help set up the program environment and manage dependencies.

## `Scope Resolution Operator`

The **scope resolution operator** (`::`) is used in C++ to **specify the scope in which an identifier, such as a 
variable, function, or class member, is defined**. It helps differentiate between entities with the same 
name in different scopes or access members of a specific namespace or class.

### `With Namespace`

The scope resolution operator is commonly used with namespaces, such as the std namespace:

Example with the `using` directive:

```cpp
using std::cout;
using std::endl;
```

Example without the `using` directive:

```cpp
std::cout << "Hello" << std::endl;
```

### `With Classes`

import { Code, TabItem, Tabs } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { code } from "@ts/references/keyterms";

<Tabs>

<TabItem label="Header" icon="document">
    <Code title="myclass.h" lang="cpp" code={code.scopeHeader}/>
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Source" icon="seti:cpp">
    <Code title="myclass.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.scopeSource} />
</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## `Stream Extraction Operator`

The stream extraction operator (`>>`) is used in C++ to **read input from a stream**, 
such as user input from the `cin` object. It extracts data from the input stream 
and stores it in the specified variable.

The operator reads input in the order it is provided and matches it to the corresponding 
variable's data type. It skips whitespace by default, making it efficient for reading 
formatted input.

```cpp
int age;
cin >> age;
```

## `Stream Insertion Operator`

The stream insertion operator (`<<`) is used in C++ to **send output to a stream**, such as 
displaying text or variables on the console using the `cout` object. It "inserts" data 
into the output stream for display.

```cpp
cout << age << endl;
```
