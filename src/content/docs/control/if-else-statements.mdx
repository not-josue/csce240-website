title: If-Else Statements
description: Learn how to use if-else statements in C++ to make decisions and execute different blocks of code based on conditional expressions.

The `if-else` statement allows a program to **choose between 
two paths based on a condition**. If the condition evaluates 
to `true`, one block of code is executed; otherwise, the 
alternative block is executed.

## Syntax

An `if-else` statement in C++ follows this basic structure:

```cpp
if (logical expression) {
  // Code to execute if condition is true
} else {
  // Code to execute if condition is false
}
```

The `else` block is optional in C++. If you only need to execute 
code when the condition is `true`, you can omit the `else` statement:

```cpp
if (condition) {
  // Code to execute if condition is true
}
```

You can nest `if-else` statements within one another to handle multiple 
conditions. This structure allows your program to make more complex 
decisions by checking additional conditions inside the `if` or `else` blocks. 
For example:

```cpp
if (true) {
  // Do something...
  if (true) {
    // Do something...
  } else {
    // Do something...
  }
} else {
  // Do something...
}
```

If you have more than 2 cases you can use as many `else if` statements as you need:

```cpp
if (condition1) {
  // Do something
} else if (condition2) {
  // Do something
} else if (condition3) {
  // Do something
} else {
  // Do something
}
```

## Style Requirements

According to the Google Style Guide, **ALWAYS** use braces {} with 
`if` and `else` statements, even if the block contains only a single 
line of code. Braces are also required if nesting `if` statements. 
The final requirement is that `else` should appear on the same line 
as the preceding closing brace `}`:

```cpp
if (account < price) {
  cout << "Insufficient funds" << endl;
} else {
  account -= price;
  cout << "Thank you for your order!" << endl;
}
```

You can omit the braces if your code block does not contain an `else` 
statement and consists of only a single line. If the statement is short 
enough, you can even place it all on one line:

```cpp
if (highest_score) cout << "You have the #1 rank!" << endl;
```

Keep in mind that omitting braces can lead to errors if additional lines are added to the block later.

### Incorrect Styles

The next examples show a couple of errors thrown by `cpplint` when your `if-else` statement is incorrectly styled. 
I've only shown the main error messages for the first two examples instead of the full error message as they only 
mention `whitespace` errors that don't really tell you what the issue is.

import { Code, TabItem, Tabs } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { code } from "@ts/control/if-else";
import { errors } from "@ts/constants";

The following is an example of an incorrectly placed opening brace:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Incorrect Style" icon="close">
    <Code lang="cpp" code={ code.wrongStyle1 } del={[1, 2]} />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Error Msg" icon="laptop">
    <Code lang="shell" code={ errors.misplacedIfBraces } />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The next incorrect style shows an incorrectly placed `else` statement:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Incorrect Style" icon="close">
    <Code lang="cpp" code={ code.wrongStyle2 } del={[3, 4]} />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Error Msg" icon="laptop">
    <Code lang="shell" code={ errors.misplacedElseBraces } />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The final incorrect style shows missing braces, unfortunately the error message does not mention missing braces on both statements:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Incorrect Style" icon="close">
    <Code lang="cpp" code={ code.wrongStyle3 } del={[1, 2, 3, 4]} />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Error Msg" icon="laptop">
    <Code lang="shell" code={ errors.missingIfElseBraces } />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Ternary Operator

Most of the operators we've encountered so far, such as `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `=` and 
comparison operators like `==` and `!=`, are **binary operators, meaning they take 
two operands**.

The conditional operator (`?:`), also known as the ternary operator, is unique 
because it takes three operands. The syntax is:

```cpp
condition ? true_action : false_action
```

They are useful for variables whose values require a condition:

```cpp
int x = 1, y = 5;
int max = (x > y) ? x : y;
```

In this example, `max` will hold the value of `y` because the condition 
`x > y` is `false`. The ternary operator is a compact alternative to `if-
else` statements for simple conditional assignments.

<Aside type="caution">
The `true` and `false` actions/values in a ternary operator must evaluate to the 
same type. If they don't, the compiler may throw an error or implicitly convert 
one value to match the other, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
