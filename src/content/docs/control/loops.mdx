Loops are a fundamental control structure in C++ that allow you to repeat actions 
efficiently based on a condition. Whether you need to iterate while a condition is 
true, ensure a block of code runs at least once, or repeat a set number of times, 
loops provide the flexibility to handle various scenarios. In this section, we'll 
explore three common types of loops: `while`, `do-while`, and `for`.

## While Loops

A `while` loop evaluates its condition at the top of the loop, before executing the body. 
If the condition evaluates to `true`, the loop continues executing the body repeatedly. 
Once the condition becomes `false`, the loop is skipped, and the program moves on to the 
commands that follow. This makes `while` loops **ideal for situations where the number of 
iterations depends on a dynamic condition rather than a fixed count**.

### Syntax

The basic syntax of a `while` loop in C++ is as follows:

```cpp
while (condition) {
  // Body of the loop
}

```

#### Key Points

- **No Semicolon:** The `while` statement should not end with a semicolon after the condition. 
Adding one will result in a syntax error or unintended behavior.

- **Scope:** Variables declared inside the loop block are local to that block and cannot be accessed outside of it. 
For example:

```cpp
while (condition) {
  int x = 10;  // 'x' is only accessible within this block
}
// x is no longer accessible here
```

### Use Case

The following is an example of a use case for a `while` loop:

import { Code, TabItem, Tabs, Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { code } from "@ts/control/loops";

<Steps>

1. Asks the user to enter a number that represents where to start a countdown from.

2. The user's number is used in a `while` loop condition to check that it is greater 
than 0.

3. The current number is logged to the terminal and then decremented.

4. After the `while` loop finishes, a message is logged to signal the end of the countdown.

</Steps>

<Tabs>

<TabItem label="Driver" icon="seti:cpp">
    <Code title="driver.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.whileExample} />
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Terminal" icon="laptop">
    <Code title="driver.cc" lang="bash" code={code.whileResult} mark={[1, 2, 4]} />
</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Style Requirements

Braces are required as `cpplint` throws an error if you omit them, and the opening brace must be on the same line as the `while` statement.
If not styled correctly, you'll get a couple of whitespace errors:

import { errors } from "@ts/constants";

<Code lang="shell" code={ errors.whileError } />

## Do-While Loops

A `do-while` loop evaluates its condition at the bottom of the loop, ensuring that the body of the 
loop is executed at least once, regardless of the condition. If the condition evaluates to `true`, 
the loop continues executing. Once the condition becomes `false`, the loop terminates, and the program 
proceeds with the commands that follow. This structure is particularly useful **when the loop's 
body must run at least once before checking the condition**.

### Syntax

The basic syntax of a `do-while` loop in C++ is as follows:

```cpp
do {
  // Body of the loop
} while (condition);
```

#### Key Point

**Semicolon:** Unlike other loops, a `do-while` loop requires a semicolon (`;`) at the end of the `while` statement. 
Omitting it will result in a syntax error.

This structure ensures that the loop is executed at least once, with clear rules for writing valid and readable do-while loops.

### Use Case

A `do-while` loop is particularly useful in scenarios where user input must be validated, and the program requires the input to be 
processed at least once before rechecking the condition. For example:

<Tabs>

<TabItem label="Driver" icon="seti:cpp">
    <Code title="driver.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.doWhileExample} />
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Terminal" icon="laptop">
    <Code title="driver.cc" lang="bash" code={code.doWhileResult} mark={[1, 2, 4, 6, 8]} />
</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Style Requirements

Just like `while` loops, braces are required in `do-while` loops as `cpplint` throws errors when omitted. The 
opening brace must be on the same line as the `do` statement and the closing brace must be in the same line as 
the `while` statement.

The following are some errors shown for improper styling:

<Code lang="shell" code={ errors.doWhileBraces } />
