Loops are a fundamental control structure in C++ that allow you to repeat actions 
efficiently based on a condition. Whether you need to iterate while a condition is 
true, ensure a block of code runs at least once, or repeat a set number of times, 
loops provide the flexibility to handle various scenarios. In this section, we'll 
explore three common types of loops: `while`, `do-while`, and `for`.

## While Loops

A `while` loop evaluates its condition at the top of the loop, before executing the body. 
If the condition evaluates to `true`, the loop continues executing the body repeatedly. 
Once the condition becomes `false`, the loop is skipped, and the program moves on to the 
commands that follow. This makes `while` loops **ideal for situations where the number of 
iterations depends on a dynamic condition rather than a fixed count**.

### Syntax

The basic syntax of a `while` loop in C++ is as follows:

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
while (condition) {
  // Body of the loop
}

```

import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<Aside type="caution">Braces are **ALWAYS** required for styling as `cpplint` throws an error if you omit them.</Aside>

#### Key Points

- **No Semicolon:** The `while` statement should not end with a semicolon after the condition. 
Adding one will result in a syntax error or unintended behavior.

- **Scope:** Variables declared inside the loop block are local to that block and cannot be accessed outside of it. 
For example:

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
while (condition) {
  int x = 10;  // 'x' is only accessible within this block
}
// x is no longer accessible here
```

### Use Case

The following is an example of a use case for a `while` loop:

import { Code, TabItem, Tabs, Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { code } from "@ts/control/loops";

<Steps>

1. Asks the user to enter a number that represents where to start a countdown from.

2. The user's number is used in a `while` loop condition to check that it is greater 
than 0.

3. The current number is logged to the terminal and then decremented.

4. After the `while` loop finishes, a message is logged to signal the end of the countdown.

</Steps>

    <Code title="driver.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.whileExample} />
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Terminal" icon="laptop">
    <Code title="driver.cc" lang="bash" code={code.whileResult} mark={[1, 3, 4, 6]} />
</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Do-While Loops

A `do-while` loop evaluates its condition at the bottom of the loop, ensuring that the body of the 
loop is executed at least once, regardless of the condition. If the condition evaluates to `true`, 
the loop continues executing. Once the condition becomes `false`, the loop terminates, and the program 
proceeds with the commands that follow. This structure is particularly useful **when the loop's 
body must run at least once before checking the condition**.

### Syntax

The basic syntax of a `do-while` loop in C++ is as follows:

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
do {
  // Body of the loop
} while (condition);
```

#### Key Point

- **Semicolon:** Unlike other loops, a `do-while` loop requires a semicolon (`;`) at the end of the `while` statement. 
Omitting it will result in a syntax error.

This structure ensures that the loop is executed at least once, with clear rules for writing valid and readable do-while loops.

### Use Case

A `do-while` loop is particularly useful in scenarios where user input must be validated, and the program requires the input to be 
processed at least once before rechecking the condition. For example:

<Tabs>

<TabItem label="Driver" icon="rocket">
    <Code title="driver.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.doWhileExample} />
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Terminal" icon="laptop">
    <Code title="driver.cc" lang="bash" code={code.doWhileResult} mark={[1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10]} />
</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## For Loops

A `for` loop is a concise way to write counter-controlled loops in C++. 
It is particularly **useful when the number of iterations is known before 
the loop begins**. By combining the initialization, condition, and update 
in a single line, for loops make the code cleaner and easier to read 
compared to `while` or `do-while` loops in such scenarios.

### Syntax

The basic syntax of a for loop in C++ is as follows:

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
for (initialization; condition; update) {
  // Body of the loop
}
```

#### Key Points

- **No Semicolon:** The `for` statement does not end with a semicolon after the 
parenthesis. Adding one will cause errors or unintended behavior.

- **Braces:** Braces `{}` are optional if the body of the loop contains only a single 
statement. However, using braces is recommended for readability and to avoid 
errors when modifying the loop.

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i)
  statement;  // No braces needed for a single line
```

- **Local Scope:** Variables declared in the parenthesis are local to the loop block and 
cannot be accessed outside of it. For example:

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
  std::cout << i << std::endl;  // 'i' is accessible here
}
// std::cout << i;  // Error: 'i' is not accessible here
```

### Use Case

A classic example of when to use a `for` loop is the **FizzBuzz** algorithmic 
problem.

#### Requirements

Write a loop that prints all numbers from 1 to 30 except for the following cases:

- If a number is divisible by 3, print `Fizz`

- If a number is divisible by 5 and not by 3, print `Buzz`

- If a number is divisible by 3 and 5, print `FizzBuzz`

<Tabs>

<TabItem label="Driver" icon="rocket">
    <Code title="driver.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.fizzBuzz} />
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Terminal" icon="laptop">
    <Code title="driver.cc" lang="bash" code={code.fizzBuzzTerminal} mark={[1, 3, 4]} />
</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Break And Continue

The `break` and `continue` commands are used to control the flow of loops in specific ways:

- `break`: Immediately **exits the current loop or code block, skipping any remaining iterations or commands**. It is often used to terminate a loop when a specific condition is met.

The following code is an algorithm to find the Least Common Multiple of two numbers within a Max Range:

<Tabs>

<TabItem label="Driver" icon="rocket">
    <Code title="driver.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.breakExample} />
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Terminal" icon="laptop">
    <Code title="driver.cc" lang="bash" code={code.breakTerminal} mark={[1, 3, 4]} />
</TabItem>

</Tabs>

- `continue`: **Skips the remaining commands in the body of the loop and moves directly to the next iteration.** This is useful when you want to bypass certain parts of the loop for specific cases without exiting the loop entirely.

The following snippet prints odd numbers within a range:

<Tabs>

<TabItem label="Driver" icon="rocket">
    <Code title="driver.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.continueExample} />
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Terminal" icon="laptop">
    <Code title="driver.cc" lang="bash" code={code.continueTerminal} mark={[1, 3, 4]} />
</TabItem>

</Tabs>
