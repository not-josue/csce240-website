Switch statements provide a more readable and efficient way to 
handle multiple conditions compared to using numerous `else if` 
statements. They work by **evaluating the value of a variable and 
executing the matching case block**.

## Syntax

Here is an example of the structure of a `switch` statement:

```cpp
switch (integer_expression) {
  case value1:
    // Case actions
    break;
  case value2:
    // Case actions
    break;
  // ...
  default:
  }
```

<Aside type="caution">
Omitting a `break` statement in a `case` block causes the program to 
execute all subsequent `case` blocks, regardless of their conditions. 
This behavior, known as **fall-through**, can lead to unintended results.

However, the `break` statement is not required in the `default` case since 
it is the last block and no further execution follows.
