Switch statements provide a more readable and efficient way to 
handle multiple conditions compared to using numerous `else if` 
statements. They work by **evaluating the value of a variable and 
executing the matching case block**.

## Syntax

Here is an example of the structure of a `switch` statement:

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
switch (integer_expression) {
  case value1:
    // Case actions
    break;
  case value2:
    // Case actions
    break;
  // ...
  default:
}
```

import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<Aside>The `default` statement is optional. </Aside>

<Aside type="caution">
Omitting a `break` statement in a `case` block causes the program to 
execute all subsequent `case` blocks, regardless of their conditions. 
This behavior, known as **fall-through**, can lead to unintended results.

However, the `break` statement is not required in the `default` case since 
it is the last block and no further execution follows.
</Aside>

## Use Cases

`switch` statements are particularly **useful for menu-driven scenarios**, where a 
user selects an option, and the program executes the corresponding code block. 
This structure makes the code more organized and easier to manage compared to 
multiple `if-else` statements.

```cpp
// Copyright 2024 CSCE240
#include <iostream>

using std::cin;
using std::cout;
using std::endl;

int main() {
  // Message user
  cout << "Welcome to the Program!" << endl;
  cout << "-----------------------" << endl;
  cout << "Enter 1: To Do This\nEnter 2: To Do That\nEnter 3: To Do "
          "Something\nEnter 4: To Quit"
       << endl;
      
  // Get user input
  int input;
  cin >> input;

  // Do something
  switch (input) {
    case 1:
      // Do this
      break;
    case 2:
      // Do that
      break;
    case 3:
      // Do something
      break;
    case 4:
      cout << "Goodbye..." << endl;
      break;
    default:
      cout << "Please select one of the allowed options..." << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

<Aside>
You would want to wrap most of the program in a `while` loop which will be covered in another section so that it repeats until the user quits.
</Aside>

`switch` statements can also be useful if you need to `return` a value when creating functions, which will be covered later. If returning a value, 
you can omit the `break` statements.

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
switch (month) {
  case 1:
    return "January";
  case 2:
    return "February";
  // Cont'd
}
```

## Style Requirements

A full list of style requirements for general control structures applied to `switch` statements can be found in the 
[control structures page](./control-structures#style-requirements).
