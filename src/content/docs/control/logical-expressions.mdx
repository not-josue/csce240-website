Logical expressions are a fundamental part of control flow in C++. They **evaluate to either true or false** and are used to 
**make decisions or repeat actions** in your programs. By combining relational operators (e.g., `==`, `<`, `>`) and logical operators 
(e.g., `&&`, `||`, `!`), you can create complex conditions that determine how your code executes.

## Relational Operators

Relational operators compare two values and return a boolean result: 
`true` if the condition is met, or `false` if it is not. These operators 
are commonly used in logical expressions to make decisions or control loops.

| Operator | Meaning | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<` | less than | `my_variable < 10` |
| `>` | greater than | `my_variable > 10` |
| `<=` | less than or equal to | `i <= size` |
| `>=` | greater than or equal to | `value >= 1` |
| `==` | equals | `value % 2 == 0` |
| `!=` | not equals | `choice != "quit"` |

## Logical Operators

In C++, the primary logical operators are AND (`&&`), OR (`||`), and NOT (`!`). 
These operators are used to evaluate multiple conditions or invert a condition's 
truth value, enabling more flexible and dynamic decision-making in your programs.

When you need to check for multiple conditions, use the AND operator:

```cpp
x > 0 && x < 10
```

The OR operator is useful when meeting multiple conditions leads to the same result:

```cpp
job == "web developer" || job == "frontend developer"
```

An example for when to use the NOT operator is when you are looking for falsy values:

```cpp
(!a_true_value)
```

## Truth Tables

Truth tables are a simple way to visualize how logical operators evaluate conditions. 
They show all possible combinations of input values and the corresponding output for 
operators like `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`.

### AND

The AND operator (`&&`) returns `true` only if both conditions are true. By looking at the 
truth table, you can see that if even one condition is `false`, the entire statement 
evaluates to `false`.

| A | B | A && B |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| `true` | `true` | `true` |
| `true` | `false` | `false` |
| `false` | `true` | `false` |
| `false` | `false` | `false` |

### OR

The OR operator (`||`) returns `true` if at least one of the conditions is `true`. By examining the 
truth table, you can see that the statement evaluates to `false` only when both conditions are `false`.

| A | B | A \|\| B |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| `true` | `true` | `true` |
| `true` | `false` | `true` |
| `false` | `true` | `true` |
| `false` | `false` | `false` |

### NOT

The NOT operator (`!`) inverts the truth value of a condition. If the condition is `true`, applying the NOT 
operator makes it `false`, and vice versa.

| A | !A |
| :---: | :---: |
| `true` | `false` |
| `false` | `true` |
