Control structures are essential for managing the flow of a 
program in C++. They determine **the order in which statements 
are executed** and allow your code to make decisions, repeat 
actions, or choose between multiple paths.

In this section, we'll explore the four main types of control 
structures: **sequential execution**, **decision-making**, **case statements**, 
and **loops**, which form the foundation of logic in programming.

## Sequential

In sequential execution, each command in the program is executed 
**one after the other, in the order they appear**. This is the simplest 
form of control flow and forms the basis for all programs, where 
instructions are carried out step by step.

The most common decision structure in C++ is the `if` statement, which 
directs the flow of execution depending on the truth value of the condition.

## Decision

In decision-making control structures, an expression is evaluated to 
determine whether it is `true` or `false`. Based on the result, **one of 
two possible paths is executed**. This allows your program to make choices 
and respond to different conditions dynamically.

## Case

The `switch` statement allows your program to **choose from multiple paths based on 
the value of a variable**. Each possible value is matched to a specific `case`, and 
the corresponding block of code is executed. This is especially useful when you 
have several distinct conditions to handle, making your code more organized and 
readable compared to using multiple `if-else` statements.

## Repetition

Repetition control structures, also known as loops, are used when **a set of commands 
needs to be executed multiple times**. Loops allow you to repeat actions efficiently, 
either for a fixed number of iterations or while a specific condition is true. 
Common loop structures in C++ include `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops, each suited 
for different types of repetition scenarios.
