We're going to walk through an example of composition in C++ by creating a `Character` classâ€”much like one you might 
find in a video game. This `Character` will contain a `Weapon` and a collection of `Potion` objects, both of which are 
separate classes that will be used within `Character`.

If you followed along with the [Basic Example tutorial](./basic-example), some of the code here may look familiar. Rather than modifying 
your existing files, however, it's best to create a new folder for this tutorial, ensuring you can experiment without 
affecting your previous work.

## Step 1. Create Files

Here are all the files that will be used in the project:

<FileTree>

- CSCE240
    - **Composition Example**
        - character.cc
        - character.h
        - driver.cc
        - makefile
        - potion.cc
        - potion.h
        - weapon.cc
        - weapon.h

</FileTree>

## Step 2. Makefile

Since we know all the names of the files, we can go ahead and create a `makefile` to 
compile and link our program:

```makefile title="makefile"
character.o : character.cc character.h potion.h weapon.h
	g++ -Wall -std=c++17 -c character.cc

potion.o : potion.cc potion.h
	g++ -Wall -std=c++17 -c potion.cc

weapon.o : weapon.cc weapon.h
	g++ -Wall -std=c++17 -c weapon.cc

driver.o : driver.cc character.h potion.h weapon.h
	g++ -Wall -std=c++17 -c driver.cc

driver: driver.o character.o potion.o weapon.o
	g++ -Wall -std=c++17 $^
	./a.out

clean :
	rm *.o a.out
```

## Step 3. Weapon Class

The first class we'll create is the `Weapon` class. It will contain a name and a type which will 
be of type `string`, and an attack power which will be represented by an integer.

### Define Header

We'll first move to `weapon.h` to define the `Weapon` class. If you look at the mutator functions, 
you will see that we are returning a reference to a `Weapon` instead of the usual `void`. This is 
to show you an example of chaining functions and is a theme you will find throughout the rest of the project:

<Code title="weapon.h" lang="cpp" code={code.weaponHeader} />

### Implement Members

Now we'll go to `weapon.cc` to write the implementation for the member functions. The first code we write 
are the imports, and what we'll be using:

```cpp title="weapon.cc" showLineNumbers=false
// Copyright 2024 CSCE240

#include "weapon.h"

#include <iostream>

using std::cout;
using std::ostream;
```

#### Mutators

Next lets write the implementation for the mutator functions. This is so we can use them in our constructor:

<Code title="weapon.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.weaponMutators} />

#### Constructor & Friend

Now we just have to write the implementation for the constructor, and our `friend`, `operator<<`:

```cpp title="weapon.cc"
// Constructor
Weapon::Weapon(string n, string t, int p) { SetName(n).SetType(t).SetPower(p); }

// Friend
ostream& operator<<(ostream& whereto, const Weapon& w) {
  whereto << w.name_ << " +" << w.power_ << " " << w.type_;
  return whereto;
}
```

## Step 4. Potion Class

The second small class to create is the `Potion` class. It will have a name, which will be either "potion" or 
"super potion", and a healing power, either `20` or `40`. Our `Character` will have an array of these to use 
to heal when they need to.

### Define Header

We'll start by defining the class in `potion.h`. A slight difference in this class is that it has a mutator 
function as `private` instead of `public`. This is because the power of the `Potion` is tied to its name, and 
we don't want to just be able to change the power to any integer other than `20` and `40`:

<Code title="potion.h" lang="cpp" code={code.potionHeader} />

### Implement Members

Now we move to `potion.cc` to write the implementation for our class. Like every other class, we first import, and 
use what we need:

```cpp title="potion.cc" showLineNumbers=false
// Copyright 2024 CSCE240

#include "potion.h"

#include <iostream>

using std::cout;
using std::endl;
using std::ostream;
```

#### Mutators

Since the power of the `Potion` is tied to its name, every time there's a name change, then there's a chance that we 
have to change the power of the `Potion`. This is the only place where we'll call the `SetPower` function:

<Code title="potion.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.potionMutators} />

#### Constructor & Friend

The final bit of implementation is the constructor and the `friend` functions. The constructor only calls the `SetName` 
function since it also initializes the power of our `Potion` and the `friend` function looks similar to the one in the 
`Weapon` class:

```cpp title="potion.cc"
// Constructor
Potion::Potion(string n) { SetName(n); }

// Friend
ostream& operator<<(ostream& whereto, const Potion& p) {
  whereto << p.name_ << " +" << p.power_;
  return whereto;
}
```

## Step 5. Character Class

The final class we'll create is the `Character` class. It will utilize the previous two classes we created. We'll give it 
a name, health points, a `Weapon`, and an array of `Potion` objects.

### Define Header

The imports for this class are different from the other classes because **it needs to import the header files of other classes 
to create objects of them**:

```cpp title="character.h" showLineNumbers=false
// Copyright 2024 CSCE240

#ifndef CHARACTER_H_
#define CHARACTER_H_

#include <ostream>
#include <string>

#include "potion.h"
#include "weapon.h"

using std::ostream;
using std::string;
```

Another difference is that since we have a pointer as a data member, we must **customize a copy constructor 
and a destructor**, and we must also **overload the assignment operator**. Since the destructor is a very short function, lets include 
the implementation in the header file:

<Code title="character.h" lang="cpp" code={code.characterHeader} />

### Implement Members

Now its time to write the implementation for the final class. We'll first import and use what we need:

```cpp title="character.cc" showLineNumbers=false
// Copyright 2024 CSCE 240

#include "character.h"

#include <iostream>

#include "potion.h"
#include "weapon.h"

using std::cout;
using std::endl;
using std::ostream;
```

#### Mutators

Like the previous two classes we'll write the mutator functions first so that we can use them in the constructor:

<Code title="character.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.characterMutators} />

#### Constructor

We'll then use some of those mutators in our constructor. This constructor shows how **you can use an initializer list 
in your constructor**. Be warned however that if you have many items in that list, the auto-styling (if you're using it) 
makes the code harder to read:

```cpp title="character.cc"
// Constructor
Character::Character(string n, int h, const Weapon& w) : weapon_(w) {
  SetName(n).SetHp(h);

  bag_capacity_ = 5;
  bag_ = new Potion[bag_capacity_];
  current_bag_size = 0;
}
```

#### Copy Constructor

The customized copy constructor is our second requirement when having a pointer as a data member. We're creating a new 
`Character` object by passing another `Character` object as the argument. We simply assign the new Character's data 
members to that of the argued one. For our pointer, we create a copy of each element since we don't want to point to 
the same memory address:

<Code title="character.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.characterCopy} />

<Aside>
You can use an initializer list for all non-pointer data members if you want. Go ahead and change the code if you want 
some practice.
</Aside>

#### PrintBag & Friend

Just like the previous two classes, lets write a way for `cout` to handle our `Character` objects. The chosen format is:

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
// Name Hp
// Weapon
// Bag
```

To achieve this structure, we're first going to need a way to print the contents of our bag. The `PrintBag` function 
first checks to see if there is anything in the bag, then runs a `for` loop and prints each `Potion` to the terminal. 
Since we've already written a way for `cout` to handle a `Potion` object, we can simply refer to the index of `bag_`:

```cpp title="character.cc"
void Character::PrintBag() const {
  if (current_bag_size == 0) {
    cout << "Your Bag is Empty" << endl;
    return;
  } else {
    for (int i = 0; i < current_bag_size; ++i) {
      cout << bag_[i] << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;
  }
}
```

We can now use the `PrintBag` function to write the implementation for our `friend` function. Just like `Potion`, we've 
already written a way for `cout` to handle a `Weapon` object:

```cpp title="character.cc"
// Friend
ostream& operator<<(ostream& whereto, const Character& c) {
  whereto << c.name_ << " " << c.hp_ << endl;
  whereto << c.weapon_ << endl;
  c.PrintBag();
  return whereto;
}
```

#### Overload Assignment

The final requirement when having a pointer as a data member is that we have to overload the assignment operator (`=`). 
The code will look very similar to that of the copy constructor with a difference being that **since we're using it on an 
object that has already been created**, **we must release the previously allocated memory by deleting the old array**:

<Code title="character.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.characterOperator} />

#### Bag Functions

The final functions we have to write all deal with inventory management. We want to be able to add a `Potion`, and use a 
`Potion` along with printing the contents of our inventory (which we've already written).

Adding a `Potion` simply requires us checking to see if the inventory is full, assigning it to an index if it isn't, and finally 
updating the current count:

```cpp title="character.cc"
// Bag Functions
void Character::AddToBag(Potion p) {
  if (current_bag_size == bag_capacity_) {
    cout << "Your Bag is Full" << endl;
    return;
  }

  bag_[current_bag_size] = p;
  ++current_bag_size;
}
```

When attempting to use a `Potion`, we run into a couple of obstacles. We have to check if the `Character` has a `Potion`, if the 
`Character` is below full health (`100` from the mutator function), and if we pass all those checks, we have to re-adjust the array 
to sort of remove the object.

<Aside>
**These functions contain default parameters in the header file meaning they will always be called** and by default will always search 
for a "potion" if no other arguments are given ("super potion" would be the other accepted type of `Potion`).
</Aside>

We'll first create a search function that returns the index of the found object, or `-1` if the object is not found:

```cpp title="character.cc"
int Character::IndexOf(string s) const {
  for (int i = 0; i < current_bag_size; ++i) {
    if (s == bag_[i].GetName()) return i;
  }
  // Not Found
  return -1;
}
```

Next we use the `IndexOf` function to adjust the array. How we adjust the array is **not always by overwriting an element**, **but 
sometimes by just ignoring it**. Take a look at the bottom of the function where we adjust the array. 

If the `Character` only has 
one potion, `i` would equal `0`. `0` is not less than the `current size - 1 = 0`, meaning that the `for` does not execute. However, 
the **current size of the bag is decremented meaning that any calls to a "bag function" immediately gets returned without iteration**. 
If the `Character` were to add another `Potion`, that value would just get rewritten:

<Code title="character.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.characterUsePotion} />

## Step 6. Test Classes

We can finally go to `driver.cc` to test and finalize our project. When completing assignments, you'll probably want to test each 
class before moving on to the next, but for demonstration purposes, we're going to test them together.


### Potion & Weapon

    We should first test the first classes we built, `Potion` and `Weapon`. This is the only time the full driver will be shown, 
    the tests that follow will only show what to add to the `main` function:

    <Tabs>

        <TabItem label="Driver" icon="rocket">
            <Code title="driver.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.test1} />
        </TabItem>

        <TabItem label="Terminal" icon="laptop">
            <Code lang="bash" code={code.term1} />
        </TabItem>

    </Tabs>

### Character Constructor

    Comment out or remove the previous `cout` statements. Lets create a custom `Character` by passing a name, health points, and 
    the `Weapon` object we previously created. By printing the `Character` object we'll be also testing the `friend` function and the 
    `PrintBag` function:

    <Tabs>

        <TabItem label="Driver" icon="rocket">
            <Code title="driver.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.test2} />
        </TabItem>

        <TabItem label="Terminal" icon="laptop">
            <Code lang="bash" code={code.term2} />
        </TabItem>

    </Tabs>

### Bag Functions

    Right under the previous code, we'll test adding potions and using them:

    <Tabs>

        <TabItem label="Driver" icon="rocket">
            <Code title="driver.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.test3} />
        </TabItem>

        <TabItem label="Terminal" icon="laptop">
            <Code lang="bash" code={code.term3} />
        </TabItem>

    </Tabs>

### Copy Constructor

    Comment out or delete the previous bag functions. Lets now test the copy constructor 
    to see if our pointers are different from each other:

    <Tabs>

        <TabItem label="Driver" icon="rocket">
            <Code title="driver.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.test4} />
        </TabItem>

        <TabItem label="Terminal" icon="laptop">
            <Code lang="bash" code={code.term4} />
        </TabItem>

    </Tabs>

### Assignment Operator 

The last test we'll do in this tutorial is the assignment operator. Just like the copy constructor, 
we're checking to see that both pointers are different from each other. We're just changing one line from 
the previous code:

<Tabs>

    <TabItem label="Driver" icon="rocket">
        <Code title="driver.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.test5} />
    </TabItem>

    <TabItem label="Terminal" icon="laptop">
        <Code lang="bash" code={code.term5} />
    </TabItem>

</Tabs>
