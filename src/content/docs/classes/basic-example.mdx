We're going to walk through the entire process of defining and using a 
class in C++. In this example, we'll create a `Character` class, 
write its member function implementations, and then test our class in a 
driver program. You'll see how these components are organized into separate files:

1. `character.h`: Header file containing the class definition.

2. `character.cc`: Source file where we implement the member functions.

3. `driver.cc`: Driver file to test and demonstrate our class.

4. `makefile`: A script that automates compiling and linking the program.

## Step 1. Create Makefile

    Since we already know the names of our files, lets first create our `makefile`:

    <Code title="makefile" lang="makefile" code={code.step1} />

## Step 2. Create Header File

    Next lets define our `Character` class in `character.h`. Don't worry if you don't 
    understand some of the code, we'll be going over each section:

    <Code title="character.h" lang="cpp" code={code.step2Base} />

    ### Data Members

    Under the `private` accessor, we've added a couple of basic stats for our class along 
    with a pointer that acts like an inventory:

    <Code title="character.h" lang="cpp" code={code.step2Data} />

    ### Constructor

   Our constructor uses default parameters, **allowing objects to 
   be created with or without arguments**. We've also declared it as `explicit` 
   to prevent unintended implicit conversions—specifically, creating a 
   `Character` object by assigning it a `string` (e.g., `Character v = "Villain";`).

   Because one of the constructor's parameters is a `string`, the `explicit` 
   keyword ensures an object is only constructed when we explicitly call the 
   constructor, rather than through an automatic type conversion:

    ```cpp title="character.h" showLineNumbers=false
    // Constructor name, hp, attack, defense
    explicit Character(string = "none", int = 0, int = 0, int = 0);
    ```

    ### Copy Constructor

    The copy constructor is **used when creating a new object by passing an 
    existing object of the same class**. In this class, we have a dynamic 
    data member (a pointer), so it's **important to create a copy constructor 
    that allocates new memory for the copy**. Otherwise, multiple objects 
    would **end up sharing the same pointer and point to the same memory**—leading 
    to issues like double-deletion and data corruption:

    ```cpp title="character.h" showLineNumbers=false
    // Copy Constructor
    Character(const Character&);
    ```
    
    ### Destructor

    Because our class contains a pointer data member, a **destructor is needed 
    to properly release any dynamically allocated memory**. In this example, 
    the destructor checks whether `bag_` is pointing to an allocated array. 
    If so, it calls `delete[]` to free the memory. Since the implementation 
    is brief, we've included it directly in the header:

    ```cpp title="character.h" showLineNumbers=false
    // Destructor
    ~Character() {
      if (bag_ != nullptr) delete[] bag_;
    }
    ```

    <Aside type="caution">
    If you have a data member that is a pointer, you should **ALWAYS write a customized copy constructor**, **and 
    a customized destructor**. There is one more rule that will be added in the next lesson.
    </Aside>
    
    ### Accessor Functions

    Just like the destructor, our Getter Functions contain very little code so we can write the 
    implementation in the header file:

    ```cpp title="character.h" showLineNumbers=false
    // Accessors
    string GetName() const { return name_; }
    int GetHp() const { return hp_; }
    int GetAtk() const { return attack_; }
    int GetDef() const { return defense_; }
    ```

    ### Mutator Functions

    Our Setter functions require a bit of conditional statements so we'll usually only define them 
    in the header file:

    ```cpp title="character.h" showLineNumbers=false
    // Mutators
    void SetName(string);
    void SetHp(int);
    void SetAtk(int);
    void SetDef(int);
    ```

    ### Utility Functions

    Since we have an inventory, we need to write a function to add items. 
    After adding items, we can write a function to print 
    the contents of the `bag_`:

    ```cpp title="character.h" showLineNumbers=false
    // Utilities
    void AddToBag(string);
    void PrintBag() const;
    ```

## Step 3. Create Source File

    Lets move to `character.cc` to write the implementation for our class. Instead 
    of feeding you the entire document, we'll go over each section.

    ### Setup

    First we setup the document by importing what we need:

    <Code title="character.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.step3Import} />

    ### Mutators

    We'll first write our mutators since we can use them in the constructor. They're 
    all pretty similar in requiring a simple condition:

    <Code title="character.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.step3Setters} />

    ### Constructor

    We can now use our mutators in the constructor to initialize some data members with 
    any arguments passed. Any data member dealing with the Character's inventory will be 
    initialized manually:

    <Code title="character.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.step3Con} />

    ### Copy Constructor

    For the copy constructor, we assign most data members of the new class to the data members 
    of the object's data members. We then iterate to pass the contents of the inventory from one 
    class to the new class:

    <Code title="character.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.step3Copy} />

    ### AddToBag

    To add an item to our inventory, we first check to see that the passed value is not an empty 
    `string` and that our inventory is not full. We then assign it to an index and updated the size:

    <Code title="character.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.step3Add} />

    ### Print

    To print our inventory we first check if the inventory is empty. Then if it contains items we 
    iterate and print each element:

    <Code title="character.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.step3Print} />

## Step 4. Test

    ### Default Constructor

    Finally we move to the driver file. Lets first check that our constructor works without any 
    arguments. This will be the only time I'll show the complete driver:

    <Tabs>

        <TabItem label="Driver" icon="rocket">
            <Code title="driver.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.step4Default} />
        </TabItem>

        <TabItem label="Terminal" icon="laptop">
            <Code lang="bash" code={code.step4DefaultTerm} />
        </TabItem>

    </Tabs>

    ### Overloaded Constructor

    Next we'll check to see that our constructor works when passing parameters. I'll only show the 
    results for the new tests instead of the entire output:

    <Tabs>

        <TabItem label="Driver" icon="rocket">
            <Code title="driver.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.step4Over} />
        </TabItem>

        <TabItem label="Terminal" icon="laptop">
            <Code lang="shell" code={code.step4OverTerm} />
        </TabItem>

    </Tabs>

    ### Copy Constructor

    Now we'll test the copy constructor by passing the previously made `Character b` object. We'll alter the 
    data in the new `Character c` to make sure the contents in `Character b` are not altered:

    <Tabs>

        <TabItem label="Driver" icon="rocket">
            <Code title="driver.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.step4Copy} />
        </TabItem>

        <TabItem label="Terminal" icon="laptop">
            <Code lang="shell" code={code.step4CopyTerm} />
        </TabItem>

    </Tabs>

    ### Inventory

    Finally we test our inventory system. We'll add some items, then test that our conditional 
    statement is working by trying to pass an empty `string`, and by trying to add an item when the 
    inventory is full:

    <Tabs>

        <TabItem label="Driver" icon="rocket">
            <Code title="driver.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.step4Bag} />
        </TabItem>

        <TabItem label="Terminal" icon="laptop">
            <Code lang="shell" code={code.step4BagTerm} />
        </TabItem>

    </Tabs>
