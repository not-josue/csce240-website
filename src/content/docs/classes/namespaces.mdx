Before diving into Inheritance, it's helpful to understand namespaces, 
as you may encounter them in upcoming assignments. In C++, **a namespace 
is a way to group multiple definitions—such as classes, functions, and 
variables—under a named umbrella**. This approach helps you **avoid naming 
conflicts** and clearly distinguishes different pieces of code, even if 
they share the same identifier.

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
namespace name {

  // All grouped definitions go here

}  // namespace name
```

## Accessing Items

Similar to how you've been using `cout`, `endl`, and other classes in your driver file, you have 
three different ways to access the code you've written in a namespace:

1. **Qualified Name**

For one time use cases like when you use `std::cout` inside of `main`:

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
csce240::ItemName x;
```

2. **Using Individual Items**

For multiple uses just like `using std::cout`:

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
using csce240::ItemName;
ItemName x;  // Direct use after the using declaration
```

3. **Using Entire Namespace**

When you want to import everything:

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
using namespace csce240;
// Now everything under csce240 can be referenced directly
```

## Example

This is an example of how your header file should look. Your header guards and import come 
before the namespace:

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
// Copyright 2024 CSCE240

#ifndef EXAMPLE_H_
#define EXAMPLE_H_

#include <iostream>

using std::cout;
using std::endl;

namespace csce240 {

class MyClass {
  // Definition
}

}  // namespace csce240

#endif
```

<Aside>
You may notice that the example class inside the namespace is not indented. This is because 
the two space indentation is NOT required inside namespaces!
</Aside>

Your source file is structured the same in that you import everything first, then 
you write your member implementation inside the namespace:

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
// Copyright 2024 CSCE240

#include <iostream>

using std::cout;
using std::endl;

namespace csce240 {

// Implementation

}  // namespace csce240

#endif
```

## Google Style

There are a couple of Google Style requirements when creating namespaces:

1. The names of a `namespace` should be in lowercase letters and should follow snake_case notation.

2. You should comment `namespace` and the name of your `namespace` after the 
ending brace. Since an ending brace is code, you need to use at least two 
spaces between code and comment to adhere to the Google Style Guide for 
commenting in the same line as code (mentioned in the [welcome page that introduced you to style requirements](../welcome/style-requirements#commenting)).
