Classes are one of the core building blocks of Object-Oriented 
Programming (OOP) in C++. Much like structs, **a class bundles data 
(called members) with the functions (called member functions)** 
that operate on that data. However, **classes default to private access**, 
giving you more control over how data is accessed and modified. 

In this page, we'll focus on the fundamental terminology and structure of 
classes, see some straightforward examples, and learn how to declare and 
organize class members—leaving advanced topics like composition, 
inheritance, and polymorphism for later pages.

## Basic Terminology

When working with classes, you'll typically organize your code in a way 
that mirrors how you separate functions into headers, source code, and a 
driver file. Here are some key terms to keep in mind:

- **Class Definition**: Declares the structure of the class, including its name, 
data members, and member function signatures. This is normally placed in a 
header file (`.h`).

- **Class Implementation**: Contains the definitions (bodies) of the member 
functions declared in the class. This is typically stored in a source file (`.cc`).

- **Member**: Refers to both the variables (data members) and the 
functions (member functions) that belong to a class.

## Access Specifiers

A class in C++ can have its members (both data and functions) 
declared under different access specifiers. These specifiers 
determine who or what can directly access those members:

- **Public**: Members declared in this section can be accessed by 
any code that can see the class, including other classes, 
functions, and class objects/pointers.

- **Private**: Members are accessible only within the class itself and 
by functions or classes declared as “friends.” Code outside of these 
contexts cannot access private members directly.

- **Protected**: Similar to private, but also grants direct access to 
classes that inherit from this class. Derived classes can directly 
access protected members, but external code cannot.

Organizing members under the appropriate **access specifiers promotes 
encapsulation**, helps prevent unintended usage, and enhances overall 
code maintainability:

```cpp title="header.h" showLineNumbers=false
class ClassName {
 public:
  //  Members (variables, functions)
 private:
  //  Members (variables, functions)
};
```

### Design Pattern 

As you experienced in CSCE146, the basic design pattern when creating a class 
is to privatize data members along with utility functions, and to publicize 
functions that have access to those data members along with a function to 
construct an instance of the Class:

```cpp title="header.h" showLineNumbers=false
class ClassName {
 public: 
  //  Constructor
  ClassName();
  //  Getters and Setters
  int GetSomething() const { return data; }
 private:
  int data_;
  //  Utility Functions
};
```

## Class Terminology

These are a couple of terms you may be familiar with from CSCE146:

- **Object**: A variable of a class type. When you declare something 
like `MyClass obj;`, `obj` is an object of type `MyClass`.

- **Instantiate**: The act of creating an object (or instance) of a class. 
In other words, you “instantiate” a class by declaring a variable of 
that class type.

- **Constructor**: A special function with the same name as the class. 
It may take parameters, but cannot return a value (not even `void`). 
The constructor is automatically called whenever you instantiate 
an object of the class, allowing you to initialize members or set 
up resources needed by the class.

### Constructors

In C++, constructors are **special member functions that initialize 
new objects of a class**. Besides the basic constructor you've already 
encountered in CSCE146, there are a few additional types and concepts 
worth understanding:

#### Default Constructor

A constructor that can be called with no arguments. If you don't 
explicitly write any constructors, the compiler provides a default 
one for you. For example:

```cpp title="header.h" showLineNumbers=false
class MyClass {
 public:
  MyClass();
};
```

#### Overloaded Constructor

You can also create a constructor that accepts parameters that initialize your 
data members:

```cpp title="header.h" showLineNumbers=false
class MyClass {
 public:
  MyClass(int, int, string);
};
```

##### Default Parameters

When you define default parameters for a constructor, the compiler uses those defaults 
if no arguments (or fewer than expected) are passed during object creation.
This makes the constructor callable with zero or fewer arguments, as long as defaults 
are provided for the missing parameters:

```cpp title="header.h" showLineNumbers=false
class MyClass {
 public:
  MyClass(int = 0, int = 0, string = "none");
};
```

#### Copy Constructor

A constructor that creates a copy of an existing object. This is 
particularly important if your class contains pointers as data 
members and needs to manage its own copies of dynamically allocated 
resources:

```cpp title="header.h" showLineNumbers=false
class MyClass {
 public:
  MyClass(const MyClass& obj) {
    // Copy constructor code
    // e.g., copying dynamically allocated resources
  }
};
```

#### `explicit` Keyword

If a constructor accepts one parameter, it can be called implicitly, 
allowing unintended type conversions. Marking such a constructor 
`explicit` ensures it is not used for implicit conversions:

```cpp title="header.h" showLineNumbers=false
class MyClass {
 public:
  explicit MyClass(int value) {
    // This constructor cannot be called implicitly with an int
  }
  int data_;
};
```

Here is an example of what can happen if you omit the `explicit` keyword. It 
is what we mean by implicitly calling the constructor when it is not 
intended:

```cpp title="driver.cc" showLineNumbers=false
// Implicitly creating a MyClass object from an int
MyClass obj = 42;  // This line will compile and call the constructor
cout << "obj.data_ = " << obj.data_ << endl;
```

**What Happens Here?**

1. **Implicit Casting**: The statement `MyClass obj = 42;` implicitly casts the integer 
`42` to a `MyClass` object. The compiler sees that `MyClass` has a constructor 
accepting an `int`, so it automatically calls that constructor.

2. **Potential Confusion**: This can be surprising or confusing if you 
didn't intend to allow an `int` to be converted into a `MyClass` object. 
It also opens the door for accidental errors in more complex code.

<Aside>
By adding the `explicit` keyword, you would prevent the code from compiling if 
there was an attempt to implicitly call the constructor for `MyClass`.
</Aside>

### Destructor

A destructor is a **special member function in C++ with the same name 
as the class but preceded by a tilde** (`~`). It cannot take any 
parameters or return a value. The destructor is **automatically called 
when an object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted**, making it 
an ideal place to release resources or perform any necessary cleanup tasks:

```cpp title="header.h" showLineNumbers=false
class MyClass {
 public:
  MyClass() {
    // Constructor: initialize members
  }
  ~MyClass() {
    // Destructor: Clean up resources here
  }
};
```

<Aside title="Static Objects Exception">
Static objects have a program-long or 
block-long lifetime. Their destructors are still called automatically 
at the end of the program's execution or when the block containing 
them exits, but their timing can be slightly different from non-static objects.
</Aside>

### Constructor & Destructor

It can be easy to mix up the timing and behavior of constructors 
and destructors when you're first getting started. Here are the 
key differences and rules to remember:

1. **Constructor Timing**

    - **Instantiation**: A constructor is called immediately when an object is created.

    - **Global Objects**: The constructors for global objects are called before `main()` 
    begins.

2. **Destructor Timing**

    - **Scope Ends**: A destructor is called as soon as the program leaves the scope 
    of the object.

    - **Static Objects**: If an object has static storage class, its destructor is called 
    once the program leaves `main()`, rather than when it goes out of scope.

3. **Stack Model (LIFO)**

    - In general, local objects follow a Last In, First Out pattern, similar to a stack. 
    The most recently created object is the first one to be destroyed when scope ends.

### Member Functions

Classes in C++ can contain different types of member functions, 
each serving a particular role. Typically, these functions help
manage access to private data, or perform internal tasks. These are the same 
type of functions you learned in CSCE146:

1. **Accessor Functions (Get Functions)**

    - A public function that returns the value of a private data member.

    - These functions are usually very short so you can write the implementation 
    in a header file.

```cpp title="header.h" showLineNumbers=false
int GetData() const { return data_; }
```

<Aside>
Notice that `const` was used after the parenthesis, now that we are using 
classes, you will have to define functions that way if they don't alter data.
</Aside>

2. **Mutator Function (Set Function)**

    - A public function that modifies the value of a private data member.

    - Implementation will be written in a source file.

```cpp title="header.h" showLineNumbers=false
void SetData(int value);
```

3. **Utility Function**

    - A private member function that performs internal tasks for 
    other member functions.

    - Implementation will be written in a source file.

```cpp title="header.h" showLineNumbers=false
class Example {
 private:
  int data_;
  void HelperFunction() {
    // Perform some internal calculation
  }

 public:
  void DoWork() {
    // DoWork can call HelperFunction internally
    HelperFunction();
  }
};
```

#### Writing Implementation

When you define a member function outside of the 
class definition in a separate source file, 
you must tie that function back to its class using the scope 
resolution operator (`::`). This tells the compiler which class 
the function belongs to:

```cpp title="source.cc" showLineNumbers=false
void Example::HelperFunction() {
  // Do Something
}
```

Here, `Example` is the class name, and `HelperFunction` is the function name. 
The `::` operator ensures the compiler associates `HelperFunction` with `Example`, 
rather than treating it as a free-standing function.

### Objects 

Once you've defined a class, creating an object is as 
straightforward as declaring any other variable. However,
accessing that object's members can vary depending on whether 
you're using an object instance directly or working through a pointer:

1. **Direct Object Declaration**

```cpp title="driver.cc" showLineNumbers=false
School s1;          // Declare an object of type School
s1.SetName("USC");  // Access public members with the dot operator
```

2. **Pointer to an Object**

```cpp title="driver.cc" showLineNumbers=false
School* sptr = new School;   // Dynamically allocate a School object
sptr->SetEnrollment(35000);  // Access members with the arrow operator (->)
delete sptr;  // Don’t forget to free dynamically allocated memory
sptr = nullptr;
```

    - **Dot Operator** (`.`): Used to access members of a directly 
    declared (non-pointer) object.

    - **Arrow Operator** (`->`): Used to access members via a pointer to an object.

## Style Requirements

There are a couple of tedious Google Style Requirements when 
creating classes. Some are caught by `cpplint` and some are not:

1. **Class Name**

    A class name should be capitalized and should follow CamelCasing if more than 
    one word. You should also have a space between the name and opening brace.

    ```cpp showLineNumbers=false
    class MyClass { };
    ```

    <Aside type="danger">
    These are cases where `cpplint` does not catch these styling errors.
    </Aside>

2. **Redundant Blank Lines**

    There should NOT be a blank line after the class name and before the closing brace.

    ```cpp showLineNumbers=false
    class MyClass {
      MyClass();  // This line should NOT be empty

      int data_;  // This line should NOT be empty
    };
    ```

    `cpplint` throws a couple of whitespace errors if your class is has this styling 
    error:

    <Code lang="shell" code={errors.classBlankSpaceError} />

3. **Access Specifier Spacing**

    Access specifiers like `public`, `private` and `protected` should be single spaced NOT double 
    spaced. There should NOT be a blank line after the access specifier. These are the whitespace/indent 
    errors thrown by `cpplint`:

    <Code lang="shell" code={errors.classSpecifierError} />

4. **Data Member Name**

    The name of data members should ALWAYS end with an underscore (`_`).

    ```cpp title="header.h" showLineNumbers=false
    int data_;
    string name_;
    ```

    <Aside type="danger">
    This is another styling error not caught by `cpplint`.
