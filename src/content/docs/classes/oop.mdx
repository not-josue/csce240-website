Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++ shifts the **focus from the 
actions your program performs (procedural programming) to the data 
and objects that drive those actions**. Instead of primarily thinking 
about functions—like “verbs”—you'll also think about nouns (objects) 
that have both attributes (data) and functionality (methods).

## What Is It?

- **Procedural Programming**: Focuses on actions (functions) and the order 
in which they're performed.

- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Focuses on objects (the “nouns”), their 
attributes (data), and their behavior (methods or functions).

## Why Use It?

- **Data Encapsulation**: Grouping data and the methods that operate on that data 
together into classes makes your code more organized and manageable.

- **Reusability**: Classes can be reused in different parts of a program or in 
different projects, reducing duplication and saving time.

- **Maintainability**: Keeping related data and functions together helps prevent errors 
and makes updating or extending functionality more straightforward.

## Example

To illustrate the principles of Object-Oriented Programming, imagine 
creating a `Character` class in a video game. This class represents a 
broad category of characters that share common attributes and behaviors. 
For example, a character might have:

### Data (Attributes)

- **Inventory**: A collection of items the character carries.

- **Health**: The current health points of the character.

- **Attack Power**: How much damage the character can deal.

- **Defense**: How well the character can withstand attacks.

- **Speed**: How quickly the character can move or act.

### Behavior (Methods)

- **Add Item to Inventory**: Allows the character to pick up items or equipment.

- **Attack**: Performs an attack on an enemy, affecting their health.

### Specific Types

From this Character base class, you can **create more specific types of 
characters**, such as a Mage or a Warrior, **each with specialized data** 
(like mana for a Mage or rage for a Warrior) **and unique behaviors** 
(like casting spells vs. using melee attacks).
