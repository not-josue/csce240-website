Polymorphism in C++ allows **different classes in the same inheritance hierarchy to 
respond uniquely to the same function call**, based on the actual type of the object 
at runtime. The term comes from Greek roots:

- **Poly**: meaning many
- **Morph**: meaning form

When used effectively, polymorphism lets you write more generic and extensible code—common 
in applications where **multiple derived classes share a base interface but implement unique behaviors**.

## Virtual Functions

Polymorphism with `virtual` functions is one of the core strengths of C++. 
By declaring functions as `virtual` in the base class and overriding them in derived classes.

### Automatic Inheritance Of `virtual`

    - Once a function is declared `virtual` in a base class, it remains `virtual` in 
    all derived classes, even if you don't explicitly repeat the `virtual` keyword.

### `override` Keyword

    - You can append `override` to a derived class's function signature 
    to explicitly state that it is overriding a virtual function from the base class.

    - If the base class function is not `virtual`, or if the signatures don't match, 
    the compiler will generate an error—catching mistakes early.

    ```cpp showLineNumbers=false
    virtual void DoSomething() override;
    ```

### `final` Keyword

    - If you place `final` after a `virtual` function's prototype, no further overriding 
    is allowed in derived classes.

    ```cpp showLineNumbers=false
    virtual void DoSomething() final;
    ```

### Implementing All Virtual Functions

    - To instantiate objects of a class (i.e., it's a concrete class), all `virtual` 
    functions (whether declared in that class or inherited) must be implemented 
    somewhere in the inheritance chain.

### Pure Virtual Functions

    - You can create a pure virtual function by setting its prototype to `= 0`:

    ```cpp showLineNumbers=false
    virtual void DoSomething() = 0;
    ```

    - A class containing one or more pure virtual functions is called an **abstract class**, 
    meaning you **cannot instantiate objects of that class directly**—it exists only to be subclassed.

    <Aside>
    This concept may remind you of the interfaces you made in CSCE146. You didn't write any implementation in 
    the `interface` but any class that used the `interface` had to have the implementation for each function.
    </Aside>

### Virtual Destructors

    - It's advisable to declare a `virtual` destructor in any base class 
    that has `virtual` functions.

    - This ensures that the correct destructor is called when you `delete` 
    an object via a base class pointer.

    - If there's no special cleanup needed in your base class, you can provide 
    an empty `virtual` destructor:

    ```cpp showLineNumbers=false
    virtual ~MyClass() {}
    ```
## Distinguishing Functions

Distinguishing how a function differs between overloading, redefining, and 
overriding is a core concept that may appear in the final exam. Below, you'll 
find a guide clarifying each concept and how they affect your code's behavior.

### Redefining Functions (Non-Virtual)

    - A non-virtual function with the same prototype in both the base and derived classes is “redefined.”

    - Such functions use early binding (also called **static binding**). The declared type 
    of the variable (not the actual runtime type) determines which function is called 
    at **compile time.**

### Virtual (Overridden) Functions

    - A virtual function is a function with the `virtual` keyword in the base class. 
    A derived class **overrides it by providing a function with the same prototype**.

    - Virtual functions use late binding (also known as **dynamic binding**). If you call 
    a virtual function via a base class pointer or reference that actually refers to a 
    derived object, the **derived class's function is called at runtime**.

### Common Confusions

    - **Overload != Redefine**: Overloading means different parameters. 
    Redefining means the same parameters in base and derived classes, 
    but no `virtual` keyword.

    - **Overload != Override**: Overriding is the `virtual` version of redefining, 
    again with the same parameters, but with `virtual`.

    - **Redefine != Override**: Redefining is non-virtual; overriding is `virtual`.
