Inheritance establishes an “is-a” relationship, where a **derived class “is a”
 specialized form of the base class**. For example, a `Warrior` class is a 
 specialized form of a `Character` class in a game, adding or overriding features 
 (e.g., unique weapons) while retaining everything common to all characters.

 **Key Terms**

 - **Base (Parent) Class**: The existing class whose members are inherited.

 - **Derived (Child) Class**: The specialized class that inherits from the base class.

 ## Why Inherit?

1. **Code Reuse**: You don't have to rewrite every piece of logic that already 
exists in the base class.

2. **Extend Functionality**: You can add new attributes or methods—or override 
existing ones—without modifying the original class.

3. **Maintainability**: Changes to common features can be made in the base class, 
automatically affecting all derived classes.

## How To Inherit

When you define a derived class, you specify which base class it inherits from, 
along with the inheritance type (e.g., `public`, `protected`, or `private`). A 
common pattern is:


 ```cpp showLineNumbers=false
 #include "parent.h"

 class ChildClass : public ParentClass {
    // State and Behavior
 };
 ```

 ## Types Of Inheritance

1. **Public Inheritance** (`class Derived : public Base`)

    - Public members of `Base` remain public in Derived.

    - Protected members of `Base` remain protected in Derived.

    - Private members of `Base` are not accessible by Derived 
    (unless via friend or member functions).

2. **Protected Inheritance** (`class Derived : protected Base`)

    - Public and protected members of `Base` become protected in Derived.

    - Private members of `Base` are still inaccessible.

3. **Private Inheritance** (`class Derived : private Base`)

    - Public and protected members of `Base` become private in Derived.

    - Private members of `Base` are still inaccessible.

The following is an example of a UML Diagram that you may be asked to identify during 
an exam. The key detail to remember is that you have a straight lined arrow pointing to the 
parent class:

## Exercises

Here are some exercises to help you understand how access specifiers work in inheritance. These exercises are very similar to 
problems you may find in an exam.

### Single Level

These problems contain a single parent and child class.

#### Public Inheritance

The `Parent` class is publicly inherited by the `Child` class in this scenario:

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
class Parent {
 public:
  void Print() const;
 protected:
  bool Contains(int) const;
 private:
  int x_;
};
```

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
class Child : public Parent {
 public:
  void GetY() const;
 protected:
  int IndexOf(int) const;
 private:
  int y_;
};
```

    - **Parent**: `Print()`

    - **Child**: `GetY()`
    </Card>
    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

#### Protected Inheritance

The `Parent` class is inherited by the `Child` class using `protected` inheritance:

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
class Parent {
 public:
  void Print() const;
 protected:
  bool Contains(int) const;
 private:
  int x_;
};
```

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
class Child : protected Parent {
 public:
  void GetY() const;
 protected:
  int IndexOf(int) const;
 private:
  int y_;
};
```

    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

#### Private Inheritance

The `Parent` class is privately inherited by the `Child` class in this scenario:

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
class Parent {
 public:
  void Print() const;
 protected:
  bool Contains(int) const;
 private:
  int x_;
};
```

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
class Child : private Parent {
 public:
  void GetY() const;
 protected:
  int IndexOf(int) const;
 private:
  int y_;
};
```

    </Card>
    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Second Level

These exercises use a parent class called `A1`, a child class called `A2`, and a grandchild class called 
`A3`.

#### Public Inheritance

In this scenario, the `A2` class inherits the `A1` class publicly, and the `A3` class 
inherits the `A2` class publicly:

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
class A1 {
 public:
  void Print() const;
 protected:
  bool Contains(int) const;
 private:
  int x_;
};
```

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
class A2 : public A1 {
 public:
  void GetY() const;
 protected:
  int IndexOf(int) const;
 private:
  int y_;
};
```

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
class A3 : public A2 {
 public:
  void GetZ() const;
 protected:
  void Swap(int);
 private:
  int z_;
};
```

    </Card>
    </TabItem>

#### Protected Inheritance

In this scenario, the `A2` class inherits the `A1` class with a `protected` accessor, and the `A3` class 
inherits the `A2` class publicly:

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
class A1 {
 public:
  void Print() const;
 protected:
  bool Contains(int) const;
 private:
  int x_;
};
```

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
class A2 : protected A1 {
 public:
  void GetY() const;
 protected:
  int IndexOf(int) const;
 private:
  int y_;
};
```

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
class A3 : public A2 {
 public:

## Inheritance Mechanics

When you instantiate an object of a derived class, **the base class 
constructor is called first**, **followed by the derived class constructor**. 
This ensures that all inherited data members and functionality are 
properly initialized before the derived class adds or modifies anything.

### Specifying The Base Constructor

You can control how the base class constructor is called by explicitly 
invoking it in the member initializer list of the derived class constructor. 
For example:

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
class Derived : public Base {
 public:
  Derived() : Base() { 
    // Constructor Body
  }
};
```

1. **Base Constructor Call**

- In this snippet, `Derived()` calls the base constructor `Base()` in its initializer list 
before executing its own constructor body.

- If you omit this call, the compiler will look for a default constructor in the base 
class—or fail to compile if no suitable constructor exists.

2. **Order Of Execution**

- The base class constructor runs first, initializing everything inherited.

- The derived class constructor runs next, completing any additional setup for the derived class.

## Redefining Functions

In C++, if a derived class redefines (or shadows) a non-virtual function from the base 
class using the same signature, the **compiler binds to that function at compile time** 
(also known as static binding). This is different from overloading, where functions 
in the same scope have distinct signatures (e.g., different parameter types or counts).

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
class Base {
 public:
  void Show();
};

class Derived : public Base {
 public:
  // Redefines the Show function
  void Show();

  // Explicitly call the Base version
  void CallOldShow() {
    Base::Show();
  }
};
```

### Key Points

1. **Compile-Time Binding**: Since the function is non-virtual (which will be covered in Polymorphism), 
the base or derived version is chosen at compile time based on the variable's declared type.

2. **Different from Overloading**: Overloading requires different signatures, whereas redefining retains 
the same signature as the base class.

3. **Calling the Base Version**: To invoke the base class implementation from within the derived class, 
use the scope resolution operator:

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
BaseClassName::FunctionName(arguments);
```

## Multiple Inheritance

Multiple inheritance allows a child class to be derived from two or more base classes. 
While you probably won't use multiple inheritance in your assignments, it is a concept 
you might encounter on an exam.

### What Is Multiple Inheritance?

In C++, multiple inheritance is when a class inherits from two or more base classes:

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
class Base1 {
 public:
  void Function:();
};

class Base2 {
 public:
  void AnotherFunc();
};

class Derived : public Base1, public Base2 {
 public:
  void MoreFunc();
}
```

### Possible Issues

1. **Ambiguity**:
If two base classes share a common ancestor, the derived class may inherit multiple 
versions of the same member, causing ambiguity.

2. **Name Conflicts**:
If two base classes have members (e.g., functions) with the same name, the derived 
class must explicitly specify which version to use.

### Use Cases

- **Use When**:  The base classes represent independent behaviors that don't overlap.

- **Do Not Use When**: The base classes share significant overlap or are tightly coupled, 
as this leads to unnecessary complexity and ambiguity. In such cases, consider using 
composition or a single inheritance hierarchy instead.
