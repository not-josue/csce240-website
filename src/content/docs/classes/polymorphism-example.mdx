This example demonstrates how to apply polymorphism in C++ by 
creating a set of video game-style character classes. Although 
it continues the gaming theme from our previous examples, no prior 
code is requiredâ€”everything you need is included here. 

You'll see how virtual functions, inheritance, and other C++ features 
allow different classes to respond to the same function calls in uniquely 
tailored ways, all while sharing a common interface.

## Step 1. Create Files

We'll be creating a base `Enemy` class along with two other specialized 
`Enemy` types: `Bomb` and `Cactuar`. Below are all the files to create:

<FileTree>

- CSCE240
    - **Polymorphism Example**
        - bomb.cc
        - bomb.h
        - cactuar.cc 
        - cactuar.h
        - enemy.cc 
        - enemy.h
        - makefile

</FileTree>

## Step 2. Update Makefile

Since we know all the names of our files, we can write all the scripts 
needed to compile and link our program in our `makefile`:

```makefile title="makefile"
enemy.o : enemy.cc enemy.h
	g++ -Wall -std=c++17 -c enemy.cc

bomb.o : bomb.cc bomb.h enemy.h
	g++ -Wall -std=c++17 -c bomb.cc

cactuar.o : cactuar.cc cactuar.h enemy.h
	g++ -Wall -std=c++17 -c cactuar.cc

driver.o : driver.cc bomb.h cactuar.h enemy.h
	g++ -Wall -std=c++17 -c driver.cc

driver : driver.o bomb.o cactuar.o enemy.o
	g++ -Wall -std=c++17 $^
	./a.out

clean :
	rm *.o a.out
```

## Step 3. Enemy Class

The `Enemy` class will be the base class that all types of enemies will inherit 
from. It will have a pure `virtual` function in `Attack`, making it an abstract 
class. Even though the class doesn't have special memory management, it will also 
contain a `virtual` destructor so that the correct destructor is called if 
someone were ever to create a pointer of our class.

### Define Header

Go to `enemy.h` and define the class. A difference between the other example tutorials 
is that we are defining this class under a `namespace`. Your course assignments will 
probably start to implement namespaces so this will serve as extra practice.

Another difference between other example tutorials is the use of a `virtual` destructor.
The `virtual` destructor will be implemented as an empty block since we don't need any 
special operations:

<Code title="enemy.h" lang="cpp" code={code.enemyHeader} />

### Define Members

Now we'll move to `enemy.cc` to write the implementation for the class. We'll first import 
what we need, and declare a `namespace` block:

```cpp title="enemy.cc" showLineNumbers=false
// Copyright 2024 CSCE240

#include "enemy.h"

#include <ostream>
#include <string>

using std::ostream;
using std::string;

namespace csce240 {

}  // namespace csce240
```

#### Mutators

Next we'll write the implementation for our mutator functions so that we can utilize them in 
the constructor. You may have noticed from the header file that the `SetName` function is 
defined under the `protected` accessor. For this program, **we don't want to change the names 
of our specialized enemies**, so this would be one way of treating the `name_` member like a 
constant, as objects would not have access to `SetName`.

```cpp title="enemy.cc" showLineNumbers=false
// Mutators
void Enemy::SetName(string n) {
  if (n != "") {
    name_ = n;
  } else {
    name_ = "none";
  }
}

void Enemy::SetHp(int h) {
  if (h > 1) {
    hp_ = h;
  } else {
    hp_ = 1;
  }
}

void Enemy::SetLevel(int l) {
  if (l > 1 && l < 100) {
    level_ = l;
  } else {
    level_ = 1;
  }
}

void Enemy::SetAtkPower(int a) {
  if (a > 1 && a < 9000) {
    atk_power_ = a;
  } else {
    atk_power_ = 1;
  }
}
```

#### Constructor

Now we can use the mutators for the class constructor. It does not require any 
complicated operations, so we'll just use each mutator to set its data members:

```cpp title="enemy.cc" showLineNumbers=false
// Constructor - name, hp, level, atk power
Enemy::Enemy(string n, int h, int l, int a) {
  SetName(n);
  SetHp(h);
  SetLevel(l);
  SetAtkPower(a);
}
```

#### Friend

Finally, we need to tell `cout` how to handle the class. We print most of its stats, leaving its `atk_power_` hidden:

```cpp title="enemy.cc" showLineNumbers=false
// Friend
ostream& operator<<(ostream& whereto, const Enemy& e) {
  // Leave atk power hidden
  whereto << e.GetName() << "\nHp: " << e.GetHp()
          << "\nLevel: " << e.GetLevel();
  return whereto;
}
```

#### Attack

As a reminder, the `Attack` function is a pure `virtual` function so no implementation 
is written in this class. However, implementation is required in any child class.

## Step 4. Bomb Class

The next class to create is the `Bomb` class. It will publicly inherit the `Enemy` class, 
and `override` the `Attack` function.

### Define Header

Go to `bomb.h`, import what you need, use the same `namespace` as the `Enemy` class, and 
define it:

<Code title="bomb.h" lang="cpp" code={code.bombHeader} />

### Define Members

Now move to `bomb.cc` to write the implementation of the `Bomb` class. The following is 
what you need to import:

```cpp title="bomb.cc" showLineNumbers=false
// Copyright 2024 CSCE240

#include "bomb.h"

#include <iostream>

#include "enemy.h"

using std::cout;
using std::endl;

namespace csce240 {

}  // namespace csce240
```

#### Constructor

The constructor is a tiny bit different than the `Enemy` class in that there is not a `string` in 
its signature. Instead the `Enemy` constructor is used in an initializer list to give an object a `name_`.
This is how we can treat the `name_` data member as a constant since it cannot be changed:

```cpp title="bomb.cc" showLineNumbers=false
// Constructor - hp, level, atk power
Bomb::Bomb(int h, int l, int a) : Enemy("Bomb", h, l, a) {}
```

#### Attack

The last function to implement is `Attack`. We simply print a statement and use arithmetic to generate how much damage 
the `Bomb` does:

```cpp title="bomb.cc" showLineNumbers=false
// Override
void Bomb::Attack() {
  cout << "Inferno Crash does " << (GetAtkPower() + GetLevel()) << " damage."
       << endl;
}
```

## Step 5. Cactuar Class

The last class to create is the `Cactuar` class. Its similar to the `Bomb` class we just created except it 
uses `Cactuar` specific data.

### Define Header

Move to `cactuar.h`, import what you need, and define the class inside the same `namespace` we've been using. 
Notice that the class redefines the `SetAtkPower` function. This is because we want to give this class a constant 
`atk_power_` and this is one way to handle such a case:

<Code title="cactuar.h" lang="cpp" code={code.cactuarHeader} />

### Define Members

Now we go to `cactuar.cc` to finalize the class. As always we first import what we need:

```cpp title="cactuar.cc" showLineNumbers=false
// Copyright 2024 CSCE240

#include "cactuar.h"

#include <iostream>

#include "enemy.h"

using std::cout;
using std::endl;

namespace csce240 {

}  // namespace csce240
```

#### Constructor

The class constructor differs from the `Bomb` class in that it only allows the `hp_` and `level_` to be passed. 
Another difference is that we use an initializer list to create a `Bomb` object 
with an `atk_power_`. For the `Cactuar` we'll make its `atk_power_` a constant `1000`:

```cpp title="cactuar.cc" showLineNumbers=false
// Constructor - hp, level
Cactuar::Cactuar(int h, int l) : Enemy("Cactuar", h, l, 1000) {}
```

#### SetAtkPower

The `Cactuar` class is special in that it always has the same `atk_power_`. To not allow an object 
to change the `atk_power_`, we simply change how the `SetAtkPower` mutator works. We just print a 
statement stating that the `atk_power_` cannot be changed and we end the function:

```cpp title="cactuar.cc" showLineNumbers=false
// Redefine Mutator
void Cactuar::SetAtkPower(int) {
  cout << "Cactuars cannot change their attack power." << endl;
}
```

#### Attack

We finish the `Cactuar` class by writing the implementation for the `Attack` function. Its similar to 
that of the one we wrote in the `Bomb` class except we print a different statement and we only use 
the constant `atk_power_` to show how much damage the object does:

```cpp title="cactuar.cc" showLineNumbers=false
// Override
void Cactuar::Attack() {
  cout << "1000 Needles does " << GetAtkPower() << " damage." << endl;
}
```

## Step 6. Test

The final step of the project is to test our classes. We move to `driver.cc` and import what we need 
which includes the class headers. We also use the classes under the `namespace` we've been using:

```cpp title="driver.cc" showLineNumbers=false
// Copyright 2024 CSCE240

#include <iostream>

#include "bomb.h"
#include "cactuar.h"
#include "enemy.h"

using std::cout;
using std::endl;

using csce240::Bomb;
using csce240::Cactuar;
```

In the `main` function, we create an object of each specialized class and test its member functions:

<Tabs>

    <TabItem label="Driver" icon="rocket">
        <Code title="driver.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.test} />
    </TabItem>

    <TabItem label="Terminal" icon="laptop">
        <Code lang="bash" code={code.term} />
    </TabItem>

</Tabs>
