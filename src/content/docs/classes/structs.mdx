Before diving fully into classes, let's take a quick look at 
structs in C++. A `struct` is a way to group related variables 
(often called members) under one name, making it easier to 
manage and pass around complex data. In many ways, structs 
are similar to classes—so similar, in fact, that **the main 
difference is that struct members are public by default**, 
whereas **class members are private by default**.

You will most likely not get an assignment involving structs, 
but you will want to know the key difference for exams.

## Syntax

A `struct` in C++ is declared similarly to a class. Here's the 
basic syntax:

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
struct StructureName {
  // Data Members
  // Member Functions
};
```

You can explicitly specify access specifiers—such as `public`, `private`, 
or `protected`—just as you would in a class. However, if you omit them, 
the contents of a struct default to `public` access:

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
struct Example {
 public:
  int x;  // Public by default
  void DoSomething() {
    // Function implementation
  }

 private:
  int y;  // This member is explicitly private
};
```

<Aside title="Google Style">
Note that the access specifiers `public` and `private` are single-spaced. 
This will also be a style requirement when creating Classes for assignments.
</Aside>

You can then create an object of the `struct` to access its data members and 
functions. If you are using a structure or a reference to a structure, you use 
the dot operator to access its data and functions:

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
Example ex;
ex.DoSomething();
cout << ex.x << endl;
```

If you are using a pointer to a structure, then you use the arrow operator 
to access its data and functions:

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
Example* ptr;
ptr->DoSomething();
ptr->x;
```
