## Example

Lets create a `Character` class and apply the topics we went over. We'll be creating 4 files:

1. `character.h`: our header file where we'll define our class.

2. `character.cc`: our source file where we'll write implementation for our functions.

3. `driver.cc`: the driver file to test our class.

4. `makefile`: the file with scripts to quickly compile, and link our program.

<Steps>

1. **Create Makefile**

    Since we already know the names of our files, lets first create our `makefile`:

    <Code title="makefile" lang="makefile" code={code.step1} />

2. **Create Header File**

    Next lets define our `Character` class in `character.h`. Don't worry if you don't 
    understand some of the code, we'll be going over each section:

    <Code title="cpp" lang="character.h" code={code.step2Base} />

    **Data Members**

    Under the `private` accessor, we've added a couple of basic stats for our class along 
    with a pointer that acts like an inventory.

    <Code title="cpp" lang="character.h" code={code.step2Data} />

    **Overloaded Constructor**

    Our overloaded constructor contains default parameters. This allows us to create an object 
    with or without parameters. Take note that we've also labelled it as `explicit`. This is 
    because one of our parameters is different (`string`) and stands for the Character's name. 
    If we don't use the `explicit` keyword, and object of our class can be created by assigning 
    it to a `string` which is something we may not want (`Character v = "Villain"`;):

    ```cpp title="character.h" showLineNumbers=false
    // Constructor name, hp, attack, defense
    explicit Character(string = "none", int = 0, int = 0, int = 0);
    ```

    **Copy Constructor**

    The copy constructor allows an object to be created by passing another object of the same class.
    Since we have a dynamic data member (pointer), it is essential that we create one so that each 
    object has its own copy of data. If we don't create copies of our `bag_`, then the pointer of 
    multiple objects will be pointing to the same address:

    ```cpp title="character.h" showLineNumbers=false
    // Copy Constructor
    Character(const Character&);
    ```
    
    **Destructor**

    The destructor we created is essential since we have a pointer as a data member. The destructor
