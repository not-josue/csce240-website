Composition is a fundamental concept in C++ that allows you to build 
complex classes by combining smaller, more specialized classes. In 
this section, we'll explore how composition works and why it's a 
powerful way to design and organize your code.

We'll also cover several advanced topics that weren't discussed in 
the previous lesson, such as the **principle of least privilege**, **constant 
functions**, **constant objects**, **initializer lists**, **friends of a class**, 
**operator overloading**, and how to **chain function calls**.

## What Is Composition?

In C++, **composition refers to a “has-a” relationship between classes**. 
One class, say Class `A`, includes one or more objects of another class, 
Class `B`, as its data members. This allows Class `A` to leverage Class B's 
functionality without needing to know or depend on how Class `B` does its job.

### Key Points

1. **"Has-A" Relationship**

    - If Class `A` “has a” Class `B`, it means `A` has `B` as a data member.

    - Example: A `Car` class might have an `Engine` object, a `Transmission` 
    object, and so on.

2. **Independence of Implementation**

    - Class `A` doesn't care how Class `B` does its job; it only cares that `B` 
    provides certain capabilities.

    - This keeps the two classes more loosely coupled and easier to maintain.

3. **Include the Header**

    - In Class A's header, include Class B's header so you can declare `B` objects in `A`.

```cpp title="header.cc" showLineNumbers=false
#include "B.h"  // Path to Class B’s header

class A {
 private:
  B objB;  // A has-a B
  // ...
};
```

4. **Separate Object Code**

    - Ensure Class B's implementation (its `.cc` file) is compiled and linked 
    in the final project alongside Class `A`.

    - Class `A` will call B's functions through `objB`, but it doesn't need to worry 
    about the details in B's `.cc`.

### UML Diagram

The following figure shows a UML Diagram of a "has-a" relationship between classes. A diagram similar to 
this is likely to show up on an exam. The key difference between other diagrams is that a **diamond 
like shape is attached to the line**.

## More About Classes

This section delves deeper into several class-related features that 
may have been mentioned before, but not fully explored. These details 
will help you refine how you design and interact with classes, improving 
both code clarity and reliability.

### Principle Of Least Privilege 

Now that your classes are going to interact with each other, 
it's important to decide what data and behaviors should be 
visible or modifiable by outside code. **The Principle of 
Least Privilege** states that functions, classes, and **other 
parts of your program should be given only the minimum access 
rights needed to do their jobs—no more**.

To adhere to this principle in C++, you'll often:

- Mark data members and functions as `private` or `protected` unless they need 
to be accessed externally.

- Use the `const` keyword liberally—to declare variables, parameters, 
member functions, and even entire objects as constant—whenever their 
values or behaviors should not change.

### Constant Functions 

A constant member function is declared with the keyword `const` at 
the end of its signature (in both the prototype and the implementation). 
Marking a member function as `const` promises the compiler—and other 
developers—that this function will not modify the object's state.

It also means the function cannot call any non-const member functions, 
ensuring the object's data remains unchanged.

We label it when defining our class in the header file:

```cpp title="header.h" showLineNumbers=false
class Character {
 public:
  int GetHp() const;

 private:
  int hp_;
};
```

We also label the function `const` when we write the implementation in 
a source file:

```cpp title="source.cc" showLineNumbers=false
int Character::GetHp() const { return hp_; }
```

#### When Is This Useful?

- **Read-Only Access**: If a function's purpose is simply to inspect or 
retrieve data without altering it—like a “getter” method—declaring 
it as `const` clearly expresses its intent and enforces it at compile time.

- **Error Prevention**: If you accidentally try to modify the object's data 
inside a `const` function, the compiler will generate an error, catching 
potential bugs early.

- **Better Design**: Declaring functions as `const` whenever possible helps you 
follow the **Principle of Least Privilege**, making your code more predictable 
and easier to maintain.

### Constant Objects 

Just like you can declare a `const int` or `const double`, you can also 
declare an entire object as `const`. Although this scenario probably won't appear 
in an assignment, it's a concept that may come up in an exam.

- **Immutable State**: A constant object cannot be modified after it is created. 
Any attempt to change its data members will result in a compiler error.

- **Calling Only Const Member Functions**: Because a constant object must remain 
unchanged, it can only call constant member functions—those declared with the 
`const` keyword at the end of their signatures.

```cpp title="driver.cc" showLineNumbers=false
int main() {
  const Character hero;
  int hp = hero.GetHp();  // Allowed since its a constant function
  hero.SetHp(200);        // Error cannot call non-constant function

  return 0;
}
```

### Initializer List

In C++, an initializer list allows you to initialize your class members 
before the constructor's body executes. It appears after the constructor's 
parameter list, starting with a colon (`:`) and followed by a comma-separated 
list of initializations. For example:

```cpp title="source.cc" showLineNumbers=false
Character::Character(string name, int health) : name_(name), health_(health) {
  // Constructor body
};
```

#### Why Use An Initializer List?

1. **Order of Initialization**: Members are initialized in the order 
they're declared in the class, not the order they appear in the 
list. Using an initializer list clarifies that order and can help 
avoid issues when you depend on one member being initialized before another.

2. **Immutable Members**: If you have `const` data members or references, you must 
use an initializer list to set their values.

3. **Efficiency**: Initializing members directly is often more efficient 
than assigning to them in the constructor body because it avoids 
unnecessary default constructions or assignments.

### Friends 

In C++, you can designate non-member functions or other classes 
as “friends” to grant them direct access to your class's `private` 
data members. This mechanism is especially **useful for operator 
overloading** in situations where the operator can't be defined as 
a member function, such as the stream insertion (`<<`) or extraction (`>>`) 
operators.

Here's an example that uses a friend function to overload the `<<` operator 
for printing:

```cpp title="header.h" showLineNumbers=false
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using std::cout;
using std::endl;
using std::ostream;
using std::string;

class Character {
 public:
  friend ostream& operator<<(ostream& whereto, const Character& c) {
    whereto << "Name: " << c.name_ << endl;
    whereto << "Hp: " << c.hp_;
    return whereto;
  }

 private:
  string name_;
  int hp_;
};
```

Here's a breakdown of the `friend` function:

1. **Operator Function**

- The `&operator<<` function is an overloaded operator that customizes 
how the `<<` operator behaves for a user-defined class. By default, the 
`<<` operator is used to output data (e.g., to `std::cout`), but it doesn't 
know how to handle objects of custom types like `Character`.

- `operator<<`: The `<<` operator is overloaded as a non-member function.

2. **Friend Declaration**

- The `friend` declaration appears inside the Character class 
but outside of any member function.

- The `friend` keyword tells the compiler that the `operator<<` 
function is allowed to access the private members (`name_` and `hp_`) of `Character`.

3. **Ostream**

- The `ostream` class, part of the Standard Library, is used for output streaming in C++. 
It represents output destinations like the console (`std::cout`) or files.

- It is used as the first parameter of the `operator<<` function to specify where 
the data should be sent.

- By returning the `ostream` reference, the function allows chained calls:

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
cout << hero << " is ready for battle!" << endl;
```

- You must include `<iostream>` and use `std::ostream` or `using std::ostream;` to use it.

<Aside>
This may remind you of the `ToString` functions you wrote in Java during CSCE146.
</Aside>

Unlike other functions, if you want to write the implementation, you do not tie the 
function to the class because it is not a member function. You also omit the `friend` keyword:

```cpp title="source.cc" showLineNumbers=false
ostream& operator<<(ostream& whereto, const Character& c) {
  // Implementation...
  return whereto;
}
```

#### Key Points

1. **Declaring A Friend**

- By prefixing `friend` to the function prototype, you explicitly grant the function 
access to the class's private members.

- This is critical when overloading certain operators (like `<<` and `>>`) that cannot 
be defined as member functions in a straightforward way.

2. **Other Uses Of Friend**

- The `friend` keyword can also be used to allow another class direct 
access to this class's `private` data, even if it's not a child class.

- In other words, you can declare `friend class SomeOtherClass;` in the 
same way you declare friend functions.

3. **Properties Of Friends**

- **Given, Not Taken**: The class itself must explicitly name the function or 
class as a `friend`; you cannot request friendship from outside.

- **Not Symmetric**: If Class `A` declares a `friend` function or class, that `friend` 
does not automatically treat `A` as a `friend`.

- **Not Transitive**: If Class `A` is friends with Class `B`, and Class `B` is friends with 
Class `C`, Class `A` is not automatically friends with Class `C`.

### Overloaded Operators

In C++, you can overload many built-in operators to work with 
your custom classes. Generally, you declare the overloaded 
operator as a member function **if (and only if) the left  
operand of the operator is an object of your class**. 

For operators where the left operand is not an object of your class 
(for example, the stream insertion operator `<<`, where the left operand is `std::ostream`), 
you must define it as a friend function (like the previous section).

#### The Rule Of Three

If you worked through the [Basic Example in the previous lesson](./basic-example), 
you saw that **having a pointer as a data member required you to 
customize a copy constructor and to customize a destructor**. The final 
requirement when you have a pointer as a data member is that you 
overload the assignment operator:

We first define it in a header file:

```cpp title="header.h" showLineNumbers=false
class Character {
 public:
  Character& operator=(const Character&);

 private:
  string name_;
  string* bag_;
  int bag_size;
};
```

We `return` a reference so we can mimic built-in types in chaining assignments, 
and to avoid unnecessary copying of objects:

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
Character a, b, c;
a = b = c;
```

Then we write the implementation in a source file. If you remember the example 
code for a customized copy constructor in the previous lesson, then this code 
will look very similar. **The key difference is that the assignment operator 
is being called on an existing object, so we have to delete the current 
pointer members to release memory**.

```cpp title="source.cc" showLineNumbers=false
Character& Character::operator=(const Character& c) {
  name_ = c.name_;
  bag_size_ = c.bag_size_;

  // Here is the difference between a copy constructor
  if (bag_ != nullptr) {
    delete[] bag_;
  }

  bag_ = new string[bag_size_];

  for (int i = 0; i < bag_size_; ++i) {
    bag_[i] = c.bag_[i];
  }

  return *this;
}
```

**Key Rule To Remember**

If you have a pointer that is a data member, you should always 
create the following:

1. **Copy Constructor**: so each new object allocates its own copy of the data

2. **Destructor**: to release the dynamically allocated memory

3. **Overload Assignment Operator**: so that assigning one object to another correctly 
copies the data

### Chaining Functions

Function chaining allows you to call multiple member functions in succession, 
using the dot operator to produce clean, fluent code. To enable this, make a 
**function `return` a reference to the current object** (typically `*this`), rather 
than returning `void`.

The implementation is included with the class definition only for example purposes:

```cpp title="header.h" showLineNumbers=false
class Character {
 public:
  Character& SetName(string name) {
    if (name != "") {
      name_ = name;
    } else {
      name_ = "none";
    }

    return *this;
  }

  void PrintName() const {
    cout << name_ << endl;
  }
};
```

Now we would have the option to set a character's name and immediately print 
it after:

```cpp title="driver.cc" showLineNumbers=false
Character c;
c.SetName("Zidane").PrintName();
```
