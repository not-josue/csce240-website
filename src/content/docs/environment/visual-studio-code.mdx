While you're free to use any code editor you're comfortable with, I highly recommend using 
<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visual 
Studio Code</a>. It's lightweight, beginner-friendly, and comes with powerful extensions 
that can streamline your workflow for CSCE240.

## Extensions

I **HIGHLY** recommend you get the C/C++ extension by Microsoft. It's going to add language 
support for C++ such as Intellisense which is going to help tremendously when developing your 
programs. 

Click on your **Extensions** tab and enter `c++` in the search bar. The extension should 
be the first to appear in the search results with over 70 million downloads.

## Auto-Formatter

Remember in [the Style Requirements page](../welcome/style-requirements#code-editor) when 
I mentioned that some code editors can be configured to automatically format your 
code? Well VSCode just so happens to be one of those ðŸ˜Š editors! You can setup auto-formatting the **quick method** by copying some code, or if you want to 
practice customizing your editor you can follow the **slower method**:

### Quick Method

<Steps>

1. Create a folder called `.vscode` in your `root` folder

2. Create a file called `settings.json` and copy the following code:

    <Code title="settings.json" lang="json" code={code.settings} />

</Steps>

### Slower Method

<Steps>

1. In VSCode, Click on **File** -> Hover Over **Preferences**, and Click **Settings**

2. Search for `@lang:cpp format`, Click on the **Workspace** tab (if you 
want to set more global settings use other tabs), and Check **Editor: Format On Save**. 

    <Aside>What we're doing is customizing the language settings for C++ to automatically format 
    any associated C++ files when the document is saved.</Aside>

3. Search for `c_cpp`, Click on **Formatting** under **C/C++**, Edit the **C_Cpp: Clang_format_fallback Style **
to be `Google`

4. Finally scroll down to **C_Cpp: Formatting** and select `clangFormat`. Above that section 
is **C_Cpp: Clang_format_style** and its value should be `file`

    <Aside>
    What we did is change the default file formatter to `clang` and require it to check for a `clang-format` 
    file that defines its styles. If no `clang-format` file is provided (which is always in our case), 
    then a file will be formatted to Google's preferred styles.
    </Aside>

5. You should now have a folder called `.vscode` in your **root folder** along with a file inside it called `settings.json`

    Check that the code in `settings.json` is similar to the following:

    <Code title="settings.json" lang="json" code={code.settings} />

</Steps>

## Testing

Create a file called `test.cc` in the **root folder**. The following should be your current file structure:

<FileTree>

- CSCE240
    - .vscode
        - settings.json
    - test.cc

</FileTree>

Copy the code in the **Before** tab and use `ctrl/cmd + s` to save. Your code should of been formatted to look like 
the **After** tab's code! Auto-formatting has now been ðŸš€ implemented! Though not perfect, it will handle most of those 
pesky style requirements.

<Tabs>

<TabItem label="Before" icon="close">
<Code title="test.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.before} />
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="After" icon="approve-check">
<Code title="test.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.after} />
</TabItem>

</Tabs>
