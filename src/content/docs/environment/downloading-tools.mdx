To get started with CSCE240, you'll need to set up a few essential tools on your computer. 
These include a C++ compiler, and a style checker to ensure your code meets 
course standards. This guide will walk you through downloading and installing everything you 
need for a smooth development experience.

## Apple Users

You can find different tools at <a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="the Hombrew website">Homebrew</a>.
At the terminal you can install what you need with the following commands:

import { Aside, Code } from "@astrojs/starlight/components"
import { code } from "@ts/environment/setup";

<Code code={code.apple} lang="zsh"/>

- `gcc` is for the C++ compiler
- `make` allows you to build your programs through a `makefile`
- `cpplint` is the linter that checks for Google Style compliancy

<Aside>
Macs already have the clang C++ compiler installed, and that compiler will be invoked with the g++ command. So,
to use the newly installed gcc C++ compiler, you'll use the command `g++-##` where ## is the version number of the gcc
compile.

You can use `gcc --version` in your terminal to see which version you have. The following command uses version 14 to compile 
a file called `hello.cc`:

<Code code={code.appleCompile} lang="zsh"/>
</Aside>

## Linux Users

You can enter the following commands in the terminal to setup the tools you need for this course:
{/* Didn't use bash so 1st line is not marked */}
<Code code={code.linux} lang="shell"/>

- `sudo apt update` is to update the list of available software and package versions
- `sudo apt upgrade` installs the latest versions of all installed packages
- `sudo apt install build-essential python3 python3-pip` installs essential build tools, Python 3, and its package manager, pip
- `sudo pip3 install cpplint` for checking C++ code against Google's style guide

## Windows Users

The Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) lets you run a full Linux environment directly on your Windows 11 or 10 computerâ€”without needing 
to set up a separate computer or install Linux as your main operating system.

import { Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components"

<Steps>

<ol>
{/* Step 01 */}
<li>
**Search Windows**

In the search bar enter `windows features` and click on the Control Panel tool:

</li>

{/* Step 02 */}
<li>
**Opt-in To Linux**

Scroll down and check `Windows Subsystem for Linux`, and restart your computer:

</li>

{/* Step 03 */}
<li>
**Download from Microsoft Store**

Search for `ubuntu lts` in the microsoft store, download it, and go through the installation process in the terminal:

<Aside> You may be asked to download some Windows fixes, and may have to restart your computer </Aside>
</li>

{/* Step 04 */}
<li>
**Create User and Download Tools**

Create a username and password, as you're creating your password you won't see any characters typed, this is a security feature in Linux.

Use the following commands to setup the tools you need for class (they are the same as the Linux section):

{/* Didn't use bash so 1st line is not marked */}
<Code code={code.windows} lang="shell"/>

`sudo apt update` is to update the list of available software and package versions

`sudo apt upgrade` installs the latest versions of all installed packages

`sudo apt install build-essential python3 python3-pip` installs essential build tools, Python 3, and its package manager, pip

`sudo pip3 install cpplint` for checking C++ code against Google's style guide
</li>

{/* Step 05 */}
<li>
**Create Course Files**

If you open Windows File Explorer, you should now see a folder for Ubuntu:

{/* Image */}
![Windows File Explorer showing a Linux Ubuntu folder](@assets/setup/file-explorer.webp)

Open the `Ubuntu` folder and then open the folder named `home`. 
In that directory you should see a folder named after your username, go ahead and open that folder. This is where your Ubuntu 
terminal opens.

To open your Ubuntu terminal open your Windows terminal, click on the down arrow, and select Ubuntu:

In your `username` folder, you can create a folder to hold all the course files. I created a `USC` folder, then a `CSCE240` folder to 
store my files. This is in case I use Linux for other courses or projects.
