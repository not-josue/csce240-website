Programming in Java during CSCE145 and CSCE146 got you used to 
arrays that "know" their own size. In C++, things work differently.

When passing an array to a function, you don't get the array's 
size “for free.” Instead, **you have to provide the array's size 
as a separate parameter**. This is because C++ doesn't store the 
size of the array; it only knows where the array begins.

The following snippet is a prototype of a function that doubles the 
value of each element in an integer array:

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
void DoubleValues(int array[], int size);
```

Here's the implementation to the previous prototype:

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
void DoubleValues(int array[], int size) {
  for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
    array[i] *= 2;
  }
}
```

Finally, this is an example of calling the function and using it on an 
integer array:

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
const int kSize = 5;
int array[kSize] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

DoubleValues(array, kSize);
```

## Constant Arrays

Another new concept in C++ is making an array parameter constant. 
By declaring an array parameter as `const`, **you guarantee that the 
function won't alter the original array**. 

This is particularly helpful for functions like `PrintArray` or `Search`,  
where the goal is only to read and display the data, not modify it. Using `const` 
also **communicates the function's behavior to other developers**, making it clear  
that the array's contents remain unchanged after the function call.

First we'll make a function prototype for a function that prints the values in 
an integer array:

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
void PrintArray(const int[], int);
```

Now we'll add the implementation:

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
void PrintArray(const int array[], int size) {
  for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
    cout << array[i] << endl;
  }
}
```

Finally, lets test the function on an integer array: 

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
const int kSize = 5;
int array[kSize] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

PrintArray(array, kSize);
```
