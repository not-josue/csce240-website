C-style strings are **arrays of characters terminated by a special null character** 
(`'\0'`) that indicates where the string ends. Although you will mostly use and 
see the `std::string` class in CSCE240, understanding C-style 
strings is essential, as it's a topic you may be tested on in this course.

## The String Class

Before diving into C-style strings, let's briefly look at the more 
modern `std::string` class provided by C++. The `std::string` class is 
defined in the `<string>` header and offers convenient functionality 
for handling text without manually managing memory or worrying about 
null terminators.

```cpp
// Copyright 2024 CSCE240

#include <iostream>
#include <string> //  Include the string library

using std::cout;
using std::endl;
using std::string;

int main() {
  string state = "South Carolina";

  cout << state << endl; //  South Carolina

  return 0;
}
```

### Helpful Topics

The following topics may or may not come up during coursework as 
simply importing the `string` library and using the `string` object 
from the Standard Library is all you really need to know.

#### Concatenation

You can use the addition `+` operator to combine strings: 

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
string first_name = "Johnny";
string last_name = "Cage";

string full_name = first_name + " " + last_name;

cout << full_name << endl;  //  Johnny Cage
```

#### Pre-Built Functions

The `string` object comes with functions which you can access using 
dot (`.`) notation.

- `append()` is a function that concatenates strings: 

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
string first_name = "Johnny";
string last_name = "Cage";

string full_name = first_name.append(" " + last_name);

cout << full_name << endl;  //  Johnny Cage
```

- `length()` and `size()` `return` how many characters are in a `string`: 

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
string course = "CSCE240";

cout << course.length() << endl;  // 7
cout << course.size() << endl;    // 7
```

#### Access Strings

You can access individual characters in `string` using bracket notation just 
like you would with non-character arrays: 

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
string example = "hello world";

cout << "First Letter: " << example[0] << endl;  // First Letter: h
cout << "Last Letter: " << example[example.length() - 1]
     << endl;  // Last Letter: d
```

## Char Arrays

C-style strings are fundamentally implemented using `char` arrays, 
which store a **sequence of characters in contiguous memory**. 
Unlike `std::string`, which manages memory and length information 
for you, a `char` array relies on a null terminator (`'\0'`) to mark 
the end of the string.

### Declaring and Initializing 

You can declare and initialize a `char` array in the same manner as 
non-character arrays:

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
const int kSize = 3;
char array1[kSize];
char array2[] = {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'};
```

<Aside>
You may not see this type of use throughout CSCE240 assignments or tests.

You can also initialize a `char` array by assigning it to a `string`:

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
char array[] = "How are you doing?";
```

#### Null Terminator

Here's an important detail about sizing and initialization: When you 
initialize a `char` array to represent a C-style `string`, **the last element 
must be the null terminator** (`'\0'`) to indicate the end of the string. 
This means that if you declare an array with a fixed size, you need to 
leave room for `'\0'`.

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
char arr[3] = "Hi";
```

`arr` becomes `{'H', 'i', '\0'}`, which is a valid null-terminated `string` of length `2`. 
However, you cannot do:

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
char arr[3] = "Bye";
```

because `"Bye"` plus the `'\0'` terminator would require `4` characters.

Similarly, when you use `string` literals to initialize a `char` array without specifying the size:

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
char greeting[] = "Hello";
```

the compiler counts the characters (`'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'`) plus the null 
terminator (`'\0'`) and allocates enough space for all `6` characters. This 
automatic inclusion of the null terminator makes it easier to work with 
C-style strings, but you must keep it in mind **whenever you explicitly 
declare the size of your char arrays**.

## Printing

If your `char` array is a valid C-style `string` (i.e., it includes a null terminator `'\0'`), 
you can print it directly using `std::cout`:

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
char greeting[] = "Hello, World!";
std::cout << greeting << std::endl;  //  Hello, World!
```

This works because `std::cout` treats a `char` array as a C-style `string` and will print 
characters until it encounters the null terminator.

### Example

Here is a simplified example of a concept you may be tested on.
The following snippet shows how the null terminator stops `std::cout` from 
printing a C-style `string`: 

<Tabs>
  
<TabItem label="Driver" icon="rocket">
  <Code title="driver.cc" lang="cpp" code={code.ex01Code}/>
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Terminal" icon="laptop">
  <Code lang="bash" code={code.ex01Term} mark={[1, 2]}/>
</TabItem>
  
</Tabs>

Since we placed a null terminator in the middle of the `string`, only `he` was 
printed to the terminal.
