An array is a fundamental data structure in C++ that provides a 
**contiguous block of memory for storing multiple values of the 
same type**. Because arrays can hold elements of any data 
typeâ€”integers, floating-point numbers, characters, or even complex 
objectsâ€”they are a versatile way to manage collections of data.

## Declaring Arrays

To declare an array use the following structure:

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
type variable_name [kSizeConstant];
```

The following is an integer array that can hold up to 5 values:

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
const int kSize = 4;
int array [kSize];
```

<Aside>
We are using `static` arrays
meaning the **size must be set when the
array is declared**, and can **NOT**
change during the course of the
program.
</Aside>

<Aside type="tip">
Use **constant variables** for the
array's size so that modifications to
the size can be made in one place.
</Aside>

Declaring an array does **not automatically initialize its values**. 
If no initial values are provided, the contents of the array 
elements are indeterminate.

You can initialize an array at the time of declaration by assigning 
it a list of values enclosed in braces `{}`. These values must be 
separated by commas, and **the compiler will determine the size of 
the array based on the number of values** provided.

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
int array[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
```

<Aside>
You can only initialize the
array with a list in the array
declaration.
</Aside>

<Aside type="tip">
You can **leave out the size 
of the array when using a list 
to initialize** the array in the 
declaration. The array's size will 
be the number of values in the 
initialization list.
</Aside>

When creating an array of numeric values, 
if you include the size of the array and 
use an initialization list, any values left 
out of the list will be set to 0. For example, 

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
int my_array[5] = { 14 }; // 14, 0, 0, 0, 0
```

## Using Arrays

In C++, the name of an array refers to the **memory address of 
its first element**. This means that when you write the array's 
name by itself, you're essentially ðŸ«µ pointing to the starting 
position of the array in memory.

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
// A location in your computer like: 0x7ffc6b2fc1d0
cout << array_name << endl;
```

To access individual elements, you use the array's name followed by 
square brackets containing the element's index `[integer]`. The following 
is an example of how to access elements in an array called `my_array`:

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
my_array[0]
my_array[1]
my_array[2]
```

<Aside>
One key characteristic of arrays in C++ is that they are 0-based, 
meaning the first element is accessed at index 0, the second at 
index 1, and so forth.
</Aside>

### Filling Numeric Arrays

You can use a `for` loop to fill a non-character array with values:

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
const int kSize = 4;
int array[kSize];

for (int i = 0; i < kSize; ++i) {
  cout << "Enter the number for index " << i << endl;
  cin >> array[i];
}
```

### Printing Numeric Arrays

You can also use a `for` loop to print a non-character array with values:

```cpp showLineNumbers=false
for (int i = 0; i < kSize; ++i) {
  cout << array[i] << endl;
}
```

### Overstepping Array Bounds

One of the most common and dangerous errors when working with arrays is 
accessing elements outside their valid range.

In C++, your **compiler will not produce an error** if you use an index 
outside of `0` to `size - 1`. Instead, it will treat the invalid 
index as a memory offset from the first element, potentially overwriting 
data that belongs to other variables or even other running programs.

This can lead to unpredictable behavior, crashes, or corrupted data.
